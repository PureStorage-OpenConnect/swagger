    ## Pure Swagger UI for FlashBlade
    A light weight tool to explore the API for FlashBlade, community supported.  
    For help with this tool, use [Pure1 Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)
    
    ## Authentication
    Use an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login, that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default. This is
    different than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token is saved and added by the built in proxy server.
    
    Use "pureadmin create --api-token" on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use "pureadmin list --api-token --expose" to show a token already created.  Note, it only shows tokens for user that is logged in.

    ## Proxy
    This Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \
    see curl API calls to IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view the console output.

    ## Error Codes
    Use HTTP Response codes to determine command results.  Error message json formats are different depending on the endpoint.

        Returns a public and private key pair, This is not part of the FlashArray API, 
        it's a helper endpoint making it easier to generate an oauth2 token_id in this Swagger UI. 
        They keys are generated in the Docker container running on this machine.
        
        Recommend to NOT use this API but to use OpenSSL instead for production use cases:
          You can generate a public and private RSA key pair like this:

            openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
            
            That generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair, encrypts them with a password you provide and writes them to a file. 
            You need to next extract the public key file. You will use this, for instance, on your web server to encrypt 
            content so that it can only be read with the private key.
            
            Export the RSA Public Key to a File
            This is a command that is
            
            openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
