  title: FlashArray REST API
  version: "2.26"

consumes:
- application/json

produces:
- application/json

tags:
- name: Authorization
  description: |
    Pure Storage uses the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange authorization grant and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
    to authenticate to the Pure Storage REST API.
    Before you can exchange the ID token for an access token, create and enable the API client
    to generate the `key_id`, `id`, and `issuer` values.
    These values will be used as JWT claims for the `subject_token` parameter.
- name: Active Directory
  description: |
    Active Directory configuration authenticates users for NFS using Kerberos or SMB using Kerberos
    or New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM). Active Directory is also used to authorize users by
    mapping identities across the NFS and SMB protocols by using LDAP queries.
- name: Administrators
  description: |
    The FlashArray has a single default administrative account named pureuser. The administrator can
    add, delete, and modify administrators on the array. Administrator roles may be assigned to user
    accounts including `array_admin`, `storage_admin`, and `readonly`.
- name: Alerts
  description: |
    Alerts indicate significant events that occur on an array, including whenever a component
    degrades or the capacity threshold of the component is reached.
- name: Alert Watchers
  description: |
    Alert watchers receive email notifications when alerts occur on an array.
- name: API Clients
  description: |
    An API client represents an identity type. API clients are created on the array.
    To create an API client, register and then enable it on the array.
    After the API client has been created, the user name (`sub`) and identity tokens (`kid` and
    `aud` tokens) that are issued by the API client are used as claims for the JSON Web Token
    that you create to authenticate into the REST API.
- name: Apps
  description: |
    Apps that extend array functionality can be integrated into the Purity//FA operating system.
- name: Arrays
  description: |
    Array features provide the ability to configure settings that affect the operation
    of the array as a whole and monitor array I/O performance.
- name: Array Connections
  description: |
    Manages connections between arrays.
- name: Audits
  description: |
    Audit trail records describe administrative actions performed by a user to modify the
    configuration of an array.
- name: Certificates
  description: |
    Purity//FA creates a self-signed certificate and private key when you start the system for the
    first time. You can use the default certificate, change the certificate attributes, create a new
    self-signed certificate, or import an SSL certificate signed by a certificate authority.
- name: Connections
  description: |
    A connection gives hosts access to volumes on the array.
- name: Container Default Protections
  description: |
    Default protection is a list of protection groups that are applied to newly created volumes.
    Volumes can opt out of the default protection at creation. The pod's `default_protections`
    defaults to the array's `default_protections` at pod creation.
    Default protection can be configured on the array and the pod.
- name: Controllers
  description: |
    Controller data includes the name, mode, FlashArray model, Purity//FA software version, and
    status of each controller in the array.
- name: Directories
  description: |
    Important file system directories should be set up as managed directories. Managed directories
    can have policies attached to them. Managed directories differ from standard directories in that
    they provide space reporting and metrics.
- name: Directory Exports
  description: |
    Managed directory exports are created by adding NFS or SMB export policies to managed
    directories.
- name: Directory Quotas
  description: |
    Directory quotas provide the ability to set capacity limits on managed directories.
- name: Directory Services
  description: |
    Manages directory service configurations for integration with LDAP servers (e.g. Active
    Directory and OpenLDAP) in order to support various array services.
- name: Directory Snapshots
  description: |
    Directory snapshots are created manually or by adding snapshot policies to managed directories.
    Each snapshot policy can be re-used for multiple directories.
- name: DNS
  description: |
    DNS attributes include the domain suffix, static name servers, mode (static or DHCP), and search
    domain. The configured attributes can be listed.
- name: Drives
  description: |
    Drive data includes the name, type, status, capacity, protocol and other information
    for all flash, NVRAM, and cache modules in an array.
- name: File Systems
  description: |
    A FlashArray can contain up to 24 separate file systems, each with a number of directories that
    can be exported via supported protocols. Clients, using Active Directory or LDAP, can connect
    and access these exports using SMB or NFS.
- name: Hardware
  description: |
    Operational status is reported by most of the hardware components in an array, including the
    chassis, controller, and storage shelf.
- name: Host Groups
  description: |
    Host groups implement consistent connections between a set of hosts and one or more volumes.
    Connections are consistent in the sense that all hosts associated with a host group
    address a volume connected to the group by the same LUN. Host groups are typically
    used to provide a common view of storage volumes to the hosts in a clustered application.
- name: Hosts
  description: |
    Hosts organize the storage network addresses (iSCSI Qualified Names, NVMe qualified names, or
    Fibre Channel world wide names) of client computers to identify the host's intiators. Hosts also
    control communications between clients and volumes. After a volume has been created, establish a
    host-volume connection so that the host can read data from and write data to the volume.
- name: KMIP
  description: |
    The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server is used in combination with the Pure
    Storage Rapid Data Locking (RDL) feature and EncryptReduce feature to further secure the
    encrypted data on a FlashArray.
- name: Maintenance Windows
  description: |
    During a maintenance window, alerts are suppressed that are related to connections, paths,
    ports, and other resources that are down during maintenance.
- name: Network Interfaces
  description: |
    Manages the interfaces and the network connection attributes of the array.
- name: Offloads
  description: |
    The offload feature enables system administrators to replicate point-in-time volume snapshots
    from the array to an external storage system for long-term retention.
    Each offload target represents an external storage system, such as an Azure Blob container,
    NFS device, or S3 bucket, to where Purity//FA volume snapshots can be replicated.
- name: Pods
  description: |
    Synchronous replication is managed through pods. A pod representing a collection of protection
    groups and volumes is created on one array and stretched to another array, resulting in fully
    synchronized writes between the two arrays. A pod can contain a mix of volumes, and protection
    groups with member volumes. Writes to the pod coming into either array are immediately
    synchronized and seen on both arrays.
- name: Pod Replica Links
  description: |
    Pod replica links are created by associating a source pod with a demoted pod, making
    the demoted pod the target pod of the source pod. The direction of the replica link is from the
    promoted source pod to the demoted target pod. Replica links can be created in either direction
    between the same two FlashArrays. The target pod of a replica link cannot be on the same
    FlashArray as the source pod.
- name: Policies
  description: |
    Policies are used to create exports (i.e., shares) and schedule snapshots. NFS and SMB policies
    can be created and have one or more rules applied to them. Each policy can be reused, creating
    exports for a number of managed directories.
- name: Ports
  description: |
    The ports on a FlashArray are assigned iSCSI Qualified Names (IQNs), NVMe Qualified Names
    (NQNs), and Fibre Channel World Wide Names (WWNs).
- name: Protection Groups
  description: |
    A protection group defines a set of volumes, hosts, or host groups (called members) that are
    protected together through snapshots with point-in-time consistency across the member volumes.
    The members within the protection group have common data protection requirements and the same
    snapshot, replication, and retention schedules.
- name: Protection Group Snapshots
  description: |
    Protection group snapshots capture the content of all volumes on the source array for the
    specified protection group at a single point in time.
- name: Remote Pods
  description: |
    A remote pod represents a pod that is on a connected array but not stretched to this array.
- name: Remote Protection Groups
  description: |
    A remote protection group represents a protection group that resides on an offload target with
    the source side of the remote protection group being another array that is connected to the
    local array. The local array can only see the remote protection groups of other arrays if the
    two arrays are connected.
- name: Remote Protection Group Snapshots
  description: |
    A remote protection group snapshot represents a protection group snapshot that resides on an
    offload target with the source side of the remote protection group snapshot being another array
    that is connected to the local array. The local array can only see the remote protection group
    snapshots of other arrays if the two arrays are connected.
- name: Remote Volume Snapshots
  description: |
    A remote volume snapshot represents a volume snapshot that resides on an offload target with the
    source side of the remote volume snapshot being another array that is connected to the local
    array. The local array can only see the remote volume snapshots of other arrays if the two
    arrays are connected.
- name: SAML2 SSO
  description: |
    SAML2 SSO allows customers to configure settings of SAML2 service provider
    and identity provider. It provides a multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    mechanism for customers to log in to FlashArray.
- name: Sessions
  description: |
    Manages Purity//FA login and user session data.
- name: SMI-S
  description: |
    Manages the Pure Storage Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S).
- name: SMTP
  description: |
    Manages connections to Simple Network Management Protocol (SMTP) managers.
- name: SNMP Agents
  description: |
    Manages connections to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents.
- name: SNMP Managers
  description: |
    Manages connections to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) managers.
- name: Software
  description: |
    Software to be installed on the array.
- name: Subnets
  description: |
    Manages the subnets and VLANs used to organize the network interfaces.
- name: Subscriptions
  description: |
    Provides information about subscription offerings.
- name: Subscription Assets
  description: |
    Provides information about subscription assets.
- name: Support
  description: |
    Enables Support to fix bugs and help customers solve problems. Support tools include proxy,
    phonehome, and remote assist.
- name: Syslog
  description: |
    Manages connections to syslog servers.
- name: Volumes
  description: |
    A volume represents a container that manages the storage space on the array. After a volume has
    been created, host-volume connections must be established so that the host can read data from
    and write data to the volume. Volume data should be protected using asynchronous replication to
    a remote array, synchronous replication between remote arrays, and replication to external
    storage systems.
- name: Volume Groups
  description: |
    Volume groups organize volumes into logical groupings. If virtual volumes are configured, each
    volume group on the FlashArray array represents its associated virtual machine, and inside each
    of those volumes groups are the FlashArray volumes that are assigned to the virtual machine.
    Volume groups that are associated with virtual machines have names that begin with `vvol-` and
    end with the virtual machine name.
- name: Volume Snapshots
  description: |
    Volume snapshots are immutable, point-in-time images of the contents of one or more volumes.
    There are two types of volume snapshots&#58; volume snapshots and protection group volume
    snapshots. A volume snapshot is a snapshot that captures the contents of a single volume.
    A protection group volume snapshot is a volume snapshot that is created from a group of
    volumes that are part of the same protection group. All of the volume snapshots created from a
    protection group snapshot are point-in-time consistent with each other.

# Per security team, this functionality needs to either be protected
# by strong authentication, or, must be internal-only. So we do both
# to facilitate the two different use cases required by both.
# To facilitate internal service bootstrap processes, there will be
# an internal version of this endpoint which is not authenticated
# (exposed only to local services). To facilitate authenticated
# external dynamic API client registration, we also support
# a strongly authenticated publicly exposed endpoint (documented

      description: |
        Deletes an array. For physical appliances, deleting an array restores the hardware to factory
        settings. This entails deleting all data, metadata, configuration, and logs. The array returns
        to the state it was in prior to any configuration changes being made. If the hardware is reused,
        it must be as a different array with a new ID.
        For virtual appliances, deleting an array puts it into an unusable state.
        Virtual resources (e.g., virtual machines) can later be freed, which deletes any remaining data,
        metadata, configuration, and logs. Prior to factory reset, an array must be manually prepared
        (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must be eradicated) and a factory reset token must be created.

        Creates a token that can be used to perform a factory reset on the array.
        Factory reset tokens can only be created after the array has been prepared
        for reset (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must first be eradicated).
        After a token has been created, operations that would take the array out of
        the prepared state are disabled (e.g., creating volumes) until all
        tokens have been deleted.

        Creates a host member and adds it to a protection group.
        Members that are already in the protection group are not affected.
        For asynchronous replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group.
        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and
        the `member_names` parameter represents the name of the host.
        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.

        Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array,
        and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time.
        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and

        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.

        Stretches a pod to an array.
        When a pod is stretched to an array,
        the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously replicated.
        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be stretched.
        The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array over which the pod is
        to be stretched.
        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.

      summary: Unstretch a pod from an array
      description: |
        Unstretches a pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a single array.
        Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod
        no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays.
        After a pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops.
        A destroyed version of the pod with "restretch" appended to the pod name
        is created on the array that no longer has the pod.
        The restretch pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod,
        just before it was unstretched.
        The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period
        starting from the time that the pod was unstretched.
        A restretch can pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered.
        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched.
        The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is
        to be unstretched.
        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.

      description: |
        Deletes a volume member from a protection group.
        After the member has been deleted, it is no longer protected by the group.
        Any protection group snapshots that were taken before the member was deleted are not affected.
        Deleting a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array,
        and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time.
        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and
        the `member_names` and `member_ids` parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume.
        The `group_names` parameter, and either the `member_names` or `member_ids`
        parameters are required and must be set together.

          LUN, or a LUN and Sublun with virtual volumes. A LUN and Sublun are
          integers in the range of 1 to 4095.

          The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single
          int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).

          In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun".
          Example: LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2
          Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.
          In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.

          To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts
          at LUN '1' and counts up to the maximum LUN '4095', assigning the first
          available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts
          at LUN '254' and counts down to the minimum LUN '1', assigning the first
          available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the '[1...254]' range are
          taken, the system starts at LUN '255' and counts up to the maximum LUN
          '4095', assigning the first available LUN to the connection. The maximum
          int64 LUN:Sublun value is 17587891081215.

            Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `demoted` to demote the pod so that it can be used as
            a link target for continuous replication between pods.
            Demoted pods do not accept write requests, and a destroyed version of the pod with
            `undo-demote` appended to the pod name is created on the array with the state of the pod
            when it was in the promoted state.
            Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `promoted` to start the process of promoting the pod.
            The `promotion_status` indicates when the pod has been successfully promoted.
            Promoted pods stop incorporating replicated data from the source pod and start accepting
            write requests.
            The replication process does not stop as the source pod continues replicating data to the
            pod.
            The space consumed by the unique replicated data is tracked by the `space.journal` field of
            the pod.

            The `promoted` status indicates that the pod has been promoted. The pod takes writes from
            hosts instead of incorporating replicated data. This is the default mode for a pod when it
            is created.
            The `demoted` status indicates that the pod has been demoted. The pod does not accept write
            requests and is ready to be used as a link target.
            The `promoting` status indicates that the pod is in an intermediate status between
            `demoted` and `promoted` while the promotion process is taking place.

          within the intersection of this `max_role` and the role of the array
          user specified as the `sub`.
          Valid values are `array_admin`, `storage_admin`, `ops_admin`, and
          `readonly`.
          Users with the `readonly` (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey the
          state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array.
          Users with the `ops_admin` (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations as
          Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops Admin users cannot
          alter the state of the array.
          Users with the `storage_admin` (Storage Admin) role can perform the same
          operations as Read Only users plus storage related operations, such as administering volumes,
          hosts, and host groups.
          Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and system configurations.
          Users with the `array_admin` (Array Admin) role can perform the same
          operations as Storage Admin users plus array-wide changes dealing with global and system
          configurations. In other words, Array Admin users can perform all operations.

            A pod can only be destroyed if it is empty, so before destroying a pod,

            Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `demoted` to demote the pod so that it can be used as
            a link target for continuous replication between pods.
            Demoted pods do not accept write requests, and a destroyed version of the pod with
            `undo-demote` appended to the pod name is created on the array with the state of the pod
            when it was in the promoted state.
            Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `promoted` to start the process of promoting the pod.
            The `promotion_status` indicates when the pod has been successfully promoted.
            Promoted pods stop incorporating replicated data from the source pod and start accepting
            write requests.
            The replication process does not stop when the source pod continues replicating data to the
            pod.
            The space consumed by the unique replicated data is tracked by the `space.journal` field
            of the pod.

          The provisioned size for a protocol endpoint is `null'.
          The provisioned size for a managed directory is the quota limit if it
          or its parent has a managed directory configured, otherwise it defaults to `null`.
          The provisioned size for a container is the sum of the total_provisioned
          of the object it contains, capped by the container's quota limit
          (or the container's used_provisioned if current usage is above the quota limit), if any.

            Valid values are `flummoxed`, `online`, `unknown`, and `unreachable`.
            Only mediators in the `online` status can mediate high availability events.
            If set to `flummoxed`, the array can reach a mediator, but it is talking to the wrong one.
            Verify that the DNS in the environment is properly configured.
            This status might also appear if the pod has been offline on one array
            for an extended period of time and the peer array is unreachable.
            If set to `online`, the array is successfully communicating with the mediator,
            and the mediator is available to mediate a high availability event.
            If set to `unreachable`, the array cannot reach the mediator,
            either due to network issues or because the mediator is down.
            When a mediator is unreachable, synchronous replication continues to function
            provided all arrays are healthy and communicating,
            but a high availability event without mediator access can result in an outage.

            One and only one array within each pod is pre-elected at a given point in time,

            If set to `offline`, the array is experiencing problems
            and may not have the latest pod data.
            The array cannot handle I/O to the pod and cannot take over
            during a high availability event.
            If set to `online`, the array is online and has the latest pod data.
            The array can handle I/O to the pod and take over during a high availability event.
            If set to `suspended`, the array is experiencing a short connection glitch of the pod.
            This is a temporary status and would transition to either `online` or `offline` soon.
            `suspended` is a new status that is exposed, starting from version 6.6.0.
            If set to `resyncing`, the array is actively getting the latest pod data
            so that it becomes fully synchronized with its peer array.
            During the resyncing process, the array cannot handle I/O to the pod.
            Once the arrays are fully synchronized, the array changes to `online` status.
            If set to `unknown`, the status of the peer array is unknown
            because this array is offline and cannot determine the state of the pod on the peer array.
            Only the peer array can ever be in unknown status; this unknown status
            is unique to the local array and will differ when viewed from its peer array.

          check includes more specific checks that failed or are anticipated to fail, set them
          using the `args` parameter. For example, the HostIOCheck check may include a list of hosts

          hosts host01 and host02, the system displays a list of these host names in the failed
          check. To override the HostIOCheck checks for host01 and host02, set `name=HostIOCheck`,

  Truncate:

      If set to `true`, reduces the size of a volume
      during a volume resize operation.
      When a volume is truncated, Purity automatically takes an undo snapshot,
      providing a 24-hour window during which the previous contents
      can be retrieved. After truncating a volume,
      its provisioned size can be subsequently increased,
      but the data in truncated sectors cannot be retrieved.
      If set to `false` or not set at all and the volume is being reduced in size,
      the volume copy operation fails.
      Required if the `provisioned` parameter is set to a volume size
      that is smaller than the original size.
