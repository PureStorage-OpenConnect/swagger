  description: "A connection gives hosts access to volumes on the array.\nThe system\

    A private connection connects one volume to one host.\nPrivate connections are\

    A shared connection connects a designated set of hosts (via a host group)\nto\
    \ a designated set of volumes, providing the hosts with a consistent \"view\"\
    \ of the volumes.\nAll associated hosts use the same LUN to address a given associated\
    \ volume.\nAll hosts and volumes associated with a host group are\nautomatically\

  description: "Host groups implement consistent connections between a set of hosts\

    The snapshot is an immutable image of the volume data at that instance in time.\n\
    The volumes are either direct members of the protection group or connected to\n\
