  title: Pure1 Public REST API
  description: "Pure1 Public REST API, developed by [Pure Storage, Inc.](https://www.purestorage.com)\n
    \nThe Pure1 REST API 2.0 offers one single form of authentication: OAuth 2.0 via the [Token Exchange
    protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange).\n\nOAuth 2.0 is an open
    protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile, desktop and
    background applications.\n\nNote that the [Authentication](#section/Authentication) section below
    mentions 'API Key' as the security scheme type. This is solely for the purpose of allowing testing
    this API with [Swagger UI](https://static.pure1.purestorage.com/api-swagger/index.html).\n\n[Knowledge
    base reference documentation](https://support.purestorage.com/Pure1/Pure1_Manage/Pure1_Manage_-_REST_API/Pure1_Manage_-_REST_API__Reference)"

        identity provider which must be either a registered application in Pure1
        or an enabled API client on the array. The token must be a JSON Web Token
        and must contain the following claims:

        > | JWT claim | Location | API Client Field | Description | Required By |

        Each token must also be signed with the private key that is paired with the
        API client's public key.

        like a controller. Others are created by the system in response to some event
        (e.g., alerts, audit records).

        Typically, a user can't create, delete or rename a built-in resource. A few
        can be created or deleted, but not renamed because the names are meaningful
        to Purity (e.g., VIFs).
