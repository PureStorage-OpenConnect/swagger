    Pure1 Public REST API, developed by [Pure Storage, Inc.](https://www.purestorage.com)

    The Pure1 REST API 2.0 offers one single form of authentication: OAuth 2.0 via the [Token Exchange protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange).

    OAuth 2.0 is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile, desktop and background applications.

    Note that the [Authentication](#section/Authentication) section below mentions 'API Key' as the security scheme type. This is solely for the purpose of allowing testing this API with [Swagger UI](https://static.pure1.purestorage.com/api-swagger/index.html).

        A built-in resource. Many are singletons predefined by Purity (e.g., support
        settings). Some correspond to a piece of software, like an app, or hardware,
        like a controller. Others are created by the system in response to some event
        (e.g., alerts, audit records).

        Typically, a user can't create, delete or rename a built-in resource. A few
        can be created or deleted, but not renamed because the names are meaningful
        to Purity (e.g., VIFs).

              Valid values are `flummoxed`, `online`, `unknown`, and `unreachable`.
              `flummoxed` - The array has the wrong UUID for the mediator. This means
              that the array can reach a mediator, but is talking to the wrong one.
              Typically, this would be due to a misconfiguration in the customer
              environment (e.g. DNS misconfiguration).
              UUIDs also have a TTL. If a pod goes offline on one array, and stays
              like that for weeks (such that the TTL expires), it may also show this
              status until the peer array is reachable again.
              `online` - The array is successfully communicating with the mediator.
              `unreachable` - The array cannot reach the mediator. This could be due
              to a network issue or the mediator is down.

              This array can not handle IO to the pod nor could it take over during an
