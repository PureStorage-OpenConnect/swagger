    upgrade_parameters:
      description: A list of parameters to be sent to the upgrade process. These parameters
        can be used to change the behavior of the upgrade process in specific ways
        such as enabling or disabling features in the target version or changing the
        attributes of the appliance at upgrade time. When there is a need or option
        to set an upgrade parameter, Pure Storage will provide documentation for the
        specific parameter. If you have been provided documentation related to a specific
        upgrade parameter, follow the instructions in the documentation. Otherwise,
        do not set any upgrade parameters.
