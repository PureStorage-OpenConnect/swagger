    allowed:
      type: boolean
      description: If set to `true`, the target array or pod allows the source array
        to replicate protection group data to the target. If set to `false`, the target
        array or pod does not allow the source array to replicate protection group
        data to the target.
      example: true
    status:
      type: string
      description: The replication status of the target. Valid values are `replicating`,
        `suspended`, and `disallowed`. If `allowed` is `true` and protection group
        data is replicating to the target, `status` will display `replicating`. If
        `allowed` is `true`, but replication is suspended due to the target being
        demoted, linked, stretched, etc., `status` will display `suspended`. Replication
        will be automatically resumed if the target becomes promoted or local only
        again. If `allowed` is `false`, `status` will display `disallowed`.
      example: suspended
