    fast_remove_directory_enabled:
      type: boolean
      description: If set to `true`, the file system, when mounted, will contain a
        directory that can be used for fast removal of other directories. Directories
        can be moved into the fast remove directory in order to have them deleted,
        and their space freed, more quickly than a normal removal operation. If not
        specified, defaults to `false`.
    hard_limit_enabled:
      type: boolean
      description: If set to `true`, the file system's size, as defined by `provisioned`,
        is used as a hard limit quota. If not specified, defaults to `false`.

      format: int64
      description: The provisioned size of the file system, displayed in bytes. If
        set to an empty string (`""`), the file system is unlimited in size. If not
        specified, defaults to unlimited.
      example: '""'
    requested_promotion_state:
      type: string
      description: Possible values are `promoted` and `demoted`. The `demoted` state
        is used for replication targets and is only allowed to be set if the file
        system is in a replica-link relationship. The additional query param `discard-non-snapshotted-data`
        must be set to `true` when demoting a file system. The default for new file
        systems is `promoted`.

    snapshot_directory_enabled:
      type: boolean
      description: If set to `true`, a hidden .snapshot directory will be present
        in each directory of the file system when it is mounted. The .snapshot directory
        allows clients read access to the contents of the snapshots that have been
        taken of a directory. If set to `false`, the .snapshot directory will not
        be present in any directories within a mounted file system. If not specified,
        defaults to `true`.

      type: boolean
      description: Whether the file system is writable or not. If `false`, this overrides
        any protocol or file permission settings and prevents changes. If `true`,
        then the protocol and file permission settings are evaluated. If not specified,
        defaults to `true`. Modifiable.
