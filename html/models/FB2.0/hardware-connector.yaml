    connector_type:
      description: Form-factor of the interface. Valid values include `QSFP` and `RJ-45`.
      type: string
      readOnly: true
      example: QSFP
    lane_speed:
      description: Configured speed of each lane in the connector in bits-per-second.
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 10000000000
    port_count:
      description: Configured number of ports in the connector (1/4 for QSFP).
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 1
    transceiver_type:
      description: Details about the transceiver which is plugged into the connector
        port. Transceiver type will be read-only for pureuser. If nothing is plugged
        into QSFP port, value will be `Unused` and type cannot be auto-detected, and
        internal user has not specified a type - value will be `Unknown`. If transceiver
        is plugged in, and type is auto-detected, and/or type has been explicitly
        set by internal user - that value will be shown. Transceiver type is not applicable
        for RJ-45 connectors.
      type: string
      readOnly: true
      example: 40GBASE-LR4
