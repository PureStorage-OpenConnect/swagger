  max_role:
    description: The maximum role allowed for ID Tokens issued by this API client.
      The bearer of an access token will be authorized to perform actions within the
      intersection of this `max_role` and the role of the array user specified as
      the JWT `sub` (subject) claim. The `max_role` field is a reference to a `role`.
      Valid `role`s are `readonly`, `ops_admin`, `array_admin`, and `storage_admin`.
      Users with the `readonly` (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey
      the state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array.
      Users with the `ops_admin` (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations
      as Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops Admin
      users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the `storage_admin` (Storage
      Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus storage
      related operations, such as administering volumes, hosts, and host groups. Storage
      Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and system configurations.
      Users with the `array_admin` (Array Admin) role can perform the same operations
      as Storage Admin users plus array-wide changes dealing with global and system
      configurations. In other words, Array Admin users can perform all operations.
