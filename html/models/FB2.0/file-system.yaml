    destroyed:
      description: Returns a value of `true` if the file system has been destroyed
        and is pending eradication. The file system cannot be modified while it is
        in the destroyed state. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of
        time left until the destroyed file system is permanently eradicated. Once
        eradication has begun, the file system can no longer be recovered. Before
        the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed file system can be
        recovered through the PATCH method by setting `destroyed=false`.
      type: boolean
    fast_remove_directory_enabled:
      description: If set to `true`, the file system, when mounted, will contain a
        directory that can be used for fast removal of other directories. Directories
        can be moved into the fast remove directory in order to have them deleted,
        and their space freed, more quickly than a normal removal operation.
      type: boolean
    hard_limit_enabled:
      description: If set to `true`, the file system's size, as defined by `provisioned`,
        is used as a hard limit quota.

    requested_promotion_state:
      description: Possible values are `promoted` and `demoted`. The `demoted` state
        is used for replication targets and is only allowed to be set if the file
        system is in a replica-link relationship. The additional query param `discard-non-snapshotted-data`
        must be set to `true` when demoting a file system. The default for new file
        systems is `promoted`.

    snapshot_directory_enabled:
      description: If set to `true`, a hidden .snapshot directory will be present
        in each directory of the file system when it is mounted. The .snapshot directory
        allows clients read access to the contents of the snapshots that have been
        taken of a directory. If set to `false`, the .snapshot directory will not
        be present in any directories within a mounted file system.

      description: Whether the file system is writable or not. If `false`, this overrides
