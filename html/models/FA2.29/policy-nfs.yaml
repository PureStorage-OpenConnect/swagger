    security:
      description: 'The security flavors to use for accessing files on this mount
        point. Values include `auth_sys`, `auth_sys-partial`, `krb5`, `krb5-partial`,
        `krb5i`, and `krb5p`. If the server does not support the requested flavor,
        the mount operation fails. If `auth_sys`, the client is trusted to specify
        the identity of the user. If `krb5`, cryptographic proof of the identity of
        the user is provided in each RPC request. Note that additional configuration
        besides adding this mount option is required in order to enable Kerberos security.
        If `krb5i`, integrity checking is added to krb5, to ensure the data has not
        been tampered with. If `krb5p`, integrity checking and encryption are added
        to `krb5`. This is the most secure setting, but it also involves the most
        performance overhead. If security option is allowed for all rules of the policy,
        it is cascaded exactly. Examples: `auth_sys`, `krb5`. If the security option
        is supported partially by the rules of the policy, it will be cascaded with
        the `-partial` suffix. Examples include: `auth_sys-partial`, `krb5-partial`.
        If the security option is not supported by any rules or there are no rules
        of the policy, then it will not be in the result array. If there are no rules
        in the policy the array of values will be empty. If there are two rules, one
        supporting auth_sys and the other supporting auth_sys and krb5 the array of
        values would contain `auth_sys` and `krb5-partial`.'
