      description: The security flavors to use for accessing files on this mount point.
        Values include `auth_sys`, `krb5`, `krb5i`, and `krb5p`. If the server does
        not support the requested flavor, the mount operation fails. This operation
        updates all rules of the specified policy. If `auth_sys`, the client is trusted
        to specify the identity of the user. If `krb5`, cryptographic proof of the
        identity of the user is provided in each RPC request. This provides strong
        verification of the identity of users accessing data on the server. Note that
        additional configuration besides adding this mount option is required to enable
        Kerberos security. If `krb5i`, integrity checking is added to krb5. This ensures
        the data has not been tampered with. If `krb5p`, integrity checking and encryption
        is added to krb5. This is the most secure setting, but it also involves the
        most performance overhead.
