      description: Valid values for existing file systems are `shared` and `native`,
        and the field can also be `null`. This field is deprecated in favor of the
        `access_control_style` field on file systems. Modification of this field is
        allowed and setting its value will change the `access_control_style` field's
        value to an equivalent value. This field will be `null` if the value of `access_control_style`
        does not match the behavior of this field being `shared` or `native`. On arrays
        that don't support REST 1.11, the default for `access_control_style` is `mode-bits`.
        On arrays that support REST 1.11, the default for `access_control_style` is
        `shared`.
