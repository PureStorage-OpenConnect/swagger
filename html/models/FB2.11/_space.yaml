  data_reduction:
    type: number
    readOnly: true
    format: float
    description: Reduction of data.
  snapshots:
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
    description: Physical usage by snapshots, other than unique in bytes.
  total_physical:
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
    description: Total physical usage (including snapshots) in bytes.
  unique:
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
    description: Unique physical space occupied by customer data, in bytes. Excludes
      snapshots, destroyed.
  virtual:
    description: The amount of logically written data, in bytes. Excludes destroyed
      data.
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64

  total_provisioned:
    description: The effective provisioned size of the container, at which a hard
      limit will be applied. For a bucket with a `quota_limit` value and `hard_limit_enabled`
      set to `true`, this is its `quota_limit` value, unless the available space of
      the associated object store account, as defined by its `quota_limit` value,
      would prevent the bucket from reaching its own `quota_limit` value. In such
      a case, `total_provisioned` will reflect the smaller value. For a file system
      with a `provisioned` value and `hard_limit_enabled` set to `true`, this is the
      `provisioned` value of the file system. For an object store account with a `quota_limit`
      value and `hard_limit_enabled` set to `true`, this is the `quota_limit` value
      of the object store account. For the array, this is the sum of the file systems
      and accounts. Measured in bytes.

  available_provisioned:
    description: The amount of space left that the current object can grow before
      writes are stopped due to a hard limit quota being hit. This is total_provisioned
      minus the virtual space used for file-systems and buckets. For array and object
      store accounts it is total_provisioned minus the virtual space used by non-destroyed
      file-systems and buckets.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0

  available_ratio:
    description: The ratio of the available space versus the total provisioned space.
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0.0
    maximum: 1.0
  destroyed:
    description: Unique physical space (excluding snapshots) occupied by destroyed
      data within the child containers, in bytes. For buckets and filesystems, the
      destroyed space will be 0 as they cannot have child containers. For the whole
      array, the space will be the sum of all destroyed buckets and filesystems.
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
  destroyed_virtual:
    description: The amount of destroyed logically written data within the child containers,
      in bytes. For buckets and filesystems, the destroyed virtual space will be 0
      as they cannot have child containers. For the whole array, the space will be
      the sum of all destroyed buckets and filesystems.
