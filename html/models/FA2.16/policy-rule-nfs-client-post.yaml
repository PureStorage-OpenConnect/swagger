        access:
          description: Specifies access control for the export. Valid values are `root-squash`,
            `all-squash`, and `no-squash`. `root-squash` prevents client users and
            groups with root privilege from mapping their root privilege to a file
            system. All users with UID 0 will have their UID mapped to anonuid. All
            users with GID 0 will have their GID mapped to anongid. `all-squash` maps
            all UIDs (including root) to anonuid and all GIDs (including root) to
            anongid. `no-squash` allows users and groups to access the file system
            with their UIDs and GIDs. The default is `root-squash` if not specified.
          type: string
        anongid:
          description: Any user whose GID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
            or `all_squash` will have their GID mapped to `anongid`. The default `anongid`
            is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear. This value is ignored when
            user mapping is enabled - see User Guide for more details.
          type: string
          example: 65530
        anonuid:
          description: Any user whose UID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
            or `all_squash` will have their UID mapped to `anonuid`. The default `anonuid`
            is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear.
          type: string
          example: 65530
        client:
          description: Specifies which clients are given access. Accepted notation
            includes IP, IP mask, or hostname. The default is `*` if not specified.
          type: string
        permission:
          description: Specifies which read-write client access permissions are allowed
            for the export. Valid values are `rw` and `ro`. The default is `rw` if
            not specified.
