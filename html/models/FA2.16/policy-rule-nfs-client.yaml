    access:
      description: Specifies access control for the export. Valid values are `root-squash`,
        `all-squash`, and `no-squash`. `root-squash` prevents client users and groups
        with root privilege from mapping their root privilege to a file system. All
        users with UID 0 will have their UID mapped to anonuid. All users with GID
        0 will have their GID mapped to anongid. `all-squash` maps all UIDs (including
        root) to anonuid and all GIDs (including root) to anongid. `no-squash` allows
        users and groups to access the file system with their UIDs and GIDs. The default
        is `root-squash` if not specified.
      type: string
      readOnly: true
    anongid:
      description: Any user whose GID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
        or `all_squash` will have their GID mapped to `anongid`. The default `anongid`
        is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear. This value is ignored when user
        mapping is enabled - see User Guide for more details.
      type: string
      example: 65530
      readOnly: true
    anonuid:
      description: Any user whose UID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
        or `all_squash` will have their UID mapped to `anonuid`. The default `anonuid`
        is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear.
