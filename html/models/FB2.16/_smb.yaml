      description: Deprecated. See File System Exports for newer functionality. The
        value returned will be the `client_policy` of the File System Export for the
        default server, and SMB, with the `export_name` matching the file system name,
        if there is one and null otherwise. Modifying this field will still work.
        If the current value is null, then setting this field will attempt to create
        a File System Export with the `client_policy` and other default values. The
        `export_name` will be the same as the file system's `name`. If the current
        value is not null, then setting this field will change the `client_policy`
        in the matching File System Export. The SMB Client policy for the file system.
        Setting a policy here grants access permissions (e.g. read-only or read-write)
        to the file system via SMB on a per-client basis. If no policy is set here,
        no client will have access. Use "" to clear.

        here grants access permissions (e.g. allow or deny Full Control, Change, and/or

        is set here, no user or group will have access. Use "" to clear.
