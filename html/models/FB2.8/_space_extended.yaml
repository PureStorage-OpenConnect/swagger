    type: number
    readOnly: true
    format: float
    description: Reduction of data.
  snapshots:
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
    description: Physical usage by snapshots, other than unique in bytes.
  total_physical:
    type: integer
    readOnly: true
    format: int64
    description: Total physical usage (including snapshots) in bytes.
  total_provisioned:
    description: The effective provisioned size of the container, at which a hard
      limit will be applied. For a bucket with a `quota_limit` value and `hard_limit_enabled`
      set to `true`, this is its `quota_limit` value, unless the available space of
      the associated object store account, as defined by its `quota_limit` value,
      would prevent the bucket from reaching its own `quota_limit` value. In such
      a case, `total_provisioned` will reflect the smaller value. For an object store
      account with a `quota_limit` value and `hard_limit_enabled` set to `true`, this
      is the `quota_limit` value of the object store account. Measured in bytes.
