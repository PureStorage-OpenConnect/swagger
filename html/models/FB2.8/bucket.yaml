        is used as a hard limit quota. If set to `false`, a hard limit quota will
        not be applied to the bucket, but soft quota alerts will still be sent if

        can only be increased and `object_lock_config.default_retention_mode` cannot
        be changed once set to `compliance`. Valid values are `unlocked` and `ratcheted`.
        Contact Pure Technical Services to change `ratcheted` to `unlocked`.
