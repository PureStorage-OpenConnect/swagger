      description: The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are
        to address the specified volume. If the LUN is not specified, the system automatically
        assigns a LUN to the connection. To automatically assign a LUN to a private
        connection, the system starts at LUN `1` and counts up to the maximum LUN
        `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. For shared connections,
        the system starts at LUN `254` and counts down to the minimum LUN `1`, assigning
        the first available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the `[1...254]`
        range are taken, the system starts at LUN `255` and counts up to the maximum
        LUN `4095`, assigning the first available LUN to the connection. Should not
        be used together with an NVMe host or host group.
