      description: 'The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are
        to address the specified volume. A LUN is set for SCSI connections only. A
        LUN can be in one of two formats: a simple LUN, or a LUN and Sublun with virtual
        volumes. The first format is simply the LUN. The second format is a single
        int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).
        In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as `LUN:Sublun`. The
        maximum int64 LUN:Sublun value is `17587891081215`.'
