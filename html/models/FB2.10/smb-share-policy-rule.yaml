    change:
      description: The state of the principal's Change access permission. Valid values
        are `allow` and `deny`. When not set, value is `null`. When allowed, includes
        all access granted by the Read permission. Users can also change data within
        files and add or delete files and folders. When denied, these operations are
        explicitly blocked. If not set for any applicable rule on any applicable policy,
        acts as an implicit deny. If set to `allow`, implicitly sets the Read permission
        to `allow`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to
        `deny`. If set to `deny`, implicitly sets the Read permission to `deny`, and
        clears the Full Control permission if it is currently `allow`. This is incompatible
        with explicitly setting any permission to `allow`. If set to an empty string
        (`""`), the value (and implicitly the Full Control permission) will be cleared.
        This is incompatible with explicitly setting the Full Control permission to
        `allow` or `deny`.

        includes all access granted by the Change permission. Users can also change
        the permissions for files and folders. When denied, these operations are explicitly
        blocked. If not set for any applicable rule on any applicable policy, acts
        as an implicit deny. If set to `allow`, implicitly sets the Change and Read
        permissions to `allow`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission
        to `deny`. If set to `deny`, implicitly sets the Change and Read permissions
        to `deny`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to
        `allow`. If set to an empty string (`""`), the value will be cleared.

        If modifying this value, providing the domain is optional. If no domain is

        `samplegroup@PureStorage`, or `sampleuser`.

    read:
      description: The state of the principal's Read access permission. Valid values
        are `allow` and `deny`. When allowed, users can view file names, read the
        data in those files, and run some programs. When denied, these operations
        are explicitly blocked. If set to `allow`, implicitly clears the Full Control
        and Change permissions if they are currently `deny`. This is incompatible
        with explicitly setting any permission to `deny`. If set to `deny`, implicitly
        clears the Full Control and Change permissions if they are currently `allow`.
        This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to `allow`.
