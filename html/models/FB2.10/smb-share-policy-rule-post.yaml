    change:
      description: The state of the principal's Change access permission. Valid values
        are `allow` and `deny`. When not set, value is `null`. When allowed, includes
        all access granted by the Read permission. Users can also change data within
        files and add or delete files and folders. When denied, these operations are
        explicitly blocked. If not set for any applicable rule on any applicable policy,
        acts as an implicit deny. If set to `allow`, implicitly sets the Read permission
        to `allow`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to
        `deny`. If set to `deny`, implicitly sets the Read permission to `deny`. This
        is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to `allow`. Defaults
        to `null`.

    full_control:
      description: The state of the principal's Full Control access permission. Valid
        values are `allow` and `deny`. When not set, value is `null`. When allowed,
        includes all access granted by the Change permission. Users can also change
        the permissions for files and folders. When denied, these operations are explicitly
        blocked. If not set for any applicable rule on any applicable policy, acts
        as an implicit deny. If set to `allow`, implicitly sets the Change and Read
        permissions to `allow`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission
        to `deny`. If set to `deny`, implicitly sets the Change and Read permissions
        to `deny`. This is incompatible with explicitly setting any permission to
        `allow`. Defaults to `null`.
      type: string
    principal:
      description: The user or group who is the subject of this rule, and optionally
        their domain. If no domain is provided, it will be derived if possible. For
        example, `PURESTORAGE\Administrator`, `samplegroup@PureStorage`, or `sampleuser`.
      type: string
    read:
      description: The state of the principal's Read access permission. Valid values
        are `allow` and `deny`. When allowed, users can view file names, read the
        data in those files, and run some programs. When denied, these operations
        are explicitly blocked. When setting to `allow`, cannot explicitly set any
        permission to `deny`. When setting to `deny`, cannot explicitly set any permission
        to `allow`.
