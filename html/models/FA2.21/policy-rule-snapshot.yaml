    destroyed:
      description: Returns a value of `true` if the pod containing the snapshot policy
        rule has been destroyed and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value
        displays the amount of time left until the destroyed policy is permanently
        eradicated. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the snapshot policy
        rule is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
      type: boolean
    keep_for:
      description: Specifies the period that snapshots are retained before they are
        eradicated, in milliseconds. The `keep_for` value cannot be less than the
        `every` value of the rule. The `keep_for` value must be unique for each rule
        in the same policy. The `keep_for` value must be between 5 minutes and 5 years.
        The `keep_for` value cannot be less than the `keep_for` value of any rule
        in the same policy with a smaller `every` value.
