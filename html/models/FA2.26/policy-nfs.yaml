      description: 'NFS protocol version allowed for the export. If NFS version is
        allowed for all rules of the policy it is cascaded exactly as: `nfsv3`, `nfsv4`.
        If the NFS version is supported partially by the rules of the policy it will
        be cascaded as: `nfsv3-partial`, `nfsv4-partial`. If the NFS version is not
        supported by any rules or there are no rules of the policy then it will not
        be in the result array. If there are no rules in the policy the array will
        be empty. If there are two rules, one supporting `nfsv3` and the other supporting
        `nfsv3` and `nfsv4` then the array would contain `nfsv3` and `nfsv4-partial`.'
