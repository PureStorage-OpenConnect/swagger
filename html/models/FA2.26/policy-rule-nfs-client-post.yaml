        access:
          description: Specifies access control for the export. Valid values are `root-squash`,
            `all-squash`, and `no-root-squash`. The value `root-squash` prevents client
            users and groups with root privilege from mapping their root privilege
            to a file system. All users with UID 0 will have their UID mapped to `anonuid`.
            All users with GID 0 will have their GID mapped to `anongid`. The value
            `all-squash` maps all UIDs (including root) to `anonuid` and all GIDs
            (including root) to `anongid`. The value `no-root-squash` allows users
            and groups to access the file system with their UIDs and GIDs. If not
            specified, the default value is `root-squash`.
          type: string
        anongid:
          description: Any user whose GID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
            or `all_squash` will have their GID mapped to `anongid`. The default `anongid`
            is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear. This value is ignored when
            user mapping is enabled.
          type: string
          example: 65530
        anonuid:
          description: Any user whose UID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
            or `all_squash` will have their UID mapped to `anonuid`. The default `anonuid`
            is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear.
          type: string
          example: 65530
        client:
          description: Specifies which clients are given access. Valid values include
            `IP`, `IP mask`, or `hostname`. The default is `*` if not specified.
          type: string
        nfs_version:
          description: NFS protocol version allowed for the export. Valid values are
            `nfsv3` and `nfsv4`. If not specified, defaults to `nfsv3`.

            type: string
            example: nfsv3
        permission:
          description: Specifies which read-write client access permissions are allowed
            for the export. Values include `rw` and `ro`. The default value is `rw`
            if not specified.
