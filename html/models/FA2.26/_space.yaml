    total_provisioned:
      description: The provisioned size of a volume for a single volume, host or host
        group, protocol endpoint, managed directory, and containers can be infinite
        or measured in bytes. Infinite is represented by `null`. The provisioned size
        for a host or host group, includes all volumes that are connected to the resource.
        The provisioned size for a protocol endpoint is `null'. The provisioned size
        for a managed directory is the quota limit if it or its parent has a managed
        directory configured, otherwise it defaults to `null`. The provisioned size
        for a container is the sum of the total_provisioned of the object it contains,
        capped by the container's quota limit (or the container's used_provisioned
        if current usage is above the quota limit), if any. Provisioned size represents
        the storage capacity reported to hosts.

    used_provisioned:
      description: The amount of logical space a container has consumed. The amount
        of logical space is compared against the quota limit if the container has
        one configured. Used provisioned does not include destroyed objects inside
        the container. For a destroyed container, used provisioned can include destroyed
        objects and represents how much logical space it would take to recover the
        container.
