    arrays:
      description: A list of arrays over which the pod is stretched. If there are
        two or more arrays in the stretched pod, all data in the pod is synchronously
        replicated between all of the arrays within the pod.

    destroyed:
      description: Returns a value of `true` if the pod has been destroyed and is
        pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time
        left until the destroyed pod is permanently eradicated. Before the `time_remaining`
        period has elapsed, the destroyed pod can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`.
        Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the pod is permanently eradicated
        and can no longer be recovered.

    failover_preferences:
      description: Determines which array within a stretched pod should be given priority
        to stay online should the arrays ever lose contact with each other. The current
        array and any peer arrays that are connected to the current array for synchronous
        replication can be added to a pod for failover preference. By default, `failover_preferences=null`,
        meaning no arrays have been configured for failover preference.

    footprint:
      description: The maximum amount of physical space the pod would take up on any
        array, ignoring any data shared outside the pod. Measured in bytes. The footprint
        metric is mostly used for capacity planning.

    requested_promotion_state:
      type: string
      description: Values include `promoted` and `demoted`. Patch `requested_promotion_state`
        to `demoted` to demote the pod so that it can be used as a link target for
        continuous replication between pods. Demoted pods do not accept write requests,
        and a destroyed version of the pod with `undo-demote` appended to the pod
        name is created on the array with the state of the pod when it was in the
        promoted state. Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `promoted` to start the
        process of promoting the pod. The `promotion_status` indicates when the pod
        has been successfully promoted. Promoted pods stop incorporating replicated
        data from the source pod and start accepting write requests. The replication
        process does not stop as the source pod continues replicating data to the
        pod. The space consumed by the unique replicated data is tracked by the `space.journal`
        field of the pod.
    promotion_status:
      type: string
      description: Current promotion status of a pod. Values include `promoted`, `demoted`,
        and `promoting`. The `promoted` status indicates that the pod has been promoted.
        The pod takes writes from hosts instead of incorporating replicated data.
        This is the default mode for a pod when it is created. The `demoted` status
        indicates that the pod has been demoted. The pod does not accept write requests
        and is ready to be used as a link target. The `promoting` status indicates
        that the pod is in an intermediate status between `demoted` and `promoted`
        while the promotion process is taking place.
    link_source_count:
      type: integer
      description: The number of source pods that link to the pod.
