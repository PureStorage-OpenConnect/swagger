    requested_promotion_state:
      description: Possible values are `promoted` and `demoted`. The `demoted` state
        is used for replication targets and is only allowed to be set if the file
        system is in a replica-link relationship. The additional query param `discard-non-snapshotted-data`
        must be set to `true` when demoting a file system. The default for new file
        systems is `promoted`.
      type: string
    writable:
      description: Whether the file system is writable or not. If `false`, this overrides
        any protocol or file permission settings and prevents changes. If `true`,
        then the protocol and file permission settings are evaluated. If not specified,
        defaults to `true`. Modifiable.
      type: boolean
