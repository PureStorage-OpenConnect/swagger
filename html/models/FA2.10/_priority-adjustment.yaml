  priority_adjustment_operator:
    description: Valid values are `+`, `-`, and `=`. The values `+` and `-` may be
      applied to volumes and volume groups to reflect the relative importance of their
      workloads. Volumes and volume groups can be assigned a priority adjustment of
      -10, 0, or +10. In addition, volumes can be assigned values of =-10, =0, or
      =+10. Volumes with settings of -10, 0, +10 can be modified by the priority adjustment
      setting of a volume group that contains the volume. However, if a volume has
      a priority adjustment set with the `=` operator (for example, =+10), it retains
      that value and is unaffected by any volume group priority adjustment settings.
    type: string
  priority_adjustment_value:

      Valid values are 0 and +10 for `+` and `-` operators, -10, 0, and +10 for the
      `=` operator.
