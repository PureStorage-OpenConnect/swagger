        at:
          description: Specifies the number of milliseconds since midnight at which
            to take a snapshot. The `at` value can only be set to an hour and must
            be between 0 and 82800000, inclusive. The `at` value can only be set on
            the rule with the smallest `every` value. The `at` value cannot be set
            if the `every` value is not measured in days. The `at` value can only
            be set for at most one rule in the same policy.

        client_name:
          description: The customizable portion of the client visible snapshot name.
            A full snapshot name is constructed in the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.NNN`
            where `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the client
            name, and `NNN` is a monotonically increasing number generated by the
            system. The client visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.NNN`.

        every:
          description: Specifies the interval between snapshots, in milliseconds.
            The `every` value for all rules must be multiples of one another. The
            `every` value must be unique for each rule in the same policy. The `every`
            value must be between 5 minutes and 1 year.

        keep_for:
          description: Specifies the period that snapshots are retained before they
            are eradicated, in milliseconds. The `keep_for` value cannot be less than
            the `every` value of the rule. The `keep_for` value must be unique for
            each rule in the same policy. The `keep_for` value must be between 5 minutes
            and 1 year.
