  at:
    description: Specifies the number of milliseconds since midnight at which to take
      a snapshot. The `at` value can only be set to an hour and must be between 0
      and 82800000, inclusive. The `at` value can only be set on the rule with the
      smallest `every` value. The `at` value cannot be set if the `every` value is
      not measured in days. The `at` value can only be set for at most one rule in
      the same policy.

    format: int64
  client_name:
    description: The snapshot client name. A full snapshot name is constructed in
      the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the managed directory name,
      `CLIENT_NAME` is the snapshot client name, and `SUFFIX` is a monotonically increasing
      number generated by the system. The client visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`.
    type: string
    required: true
  every:
    description: Specifies the interval between snapshots, in milliseconds. The `every`
      value for all rules must be multiples of one another. The `every` value must
      be unique for each rule in the same policy. The `every` value must be between
      5 minutes and 1 year.

    format: int64
    required: true
  keep_for:
    description: Specifies the period that snapshots are retained before they are
      eradicated, in milliseconds. The `keep_for` value cannot be less than the `every`
      value of the rule. The `keep_for` value must be unique for each rule in the
      same policy. The `keep_for` value must be between 5 minutes and 1 year. The
      `keep_for` value cannot be less than the `keep_for` value of any rule in the
      same policy with a smaller `every` value.
