      description: Returns a value of `true` if the snapshot has been destroyed and

        time left until the destroyed directory snapshot is permanently eradicated.
        Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed directory snapshot
        can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period
        has elapsed, the directory snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer
        be recovered.
