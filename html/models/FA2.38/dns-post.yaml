    description: The list of DNS servers either in the form of IP addresses or HTTPS
      endpoints. Domain names in HTTPS endpoints are not supported. IP addresses must
      be used instead. If nameservers begin with `https://`, then DNS queries will
      be performed over HTTPS. Otherwise, unencrypted DNS queries will be performed.
      Using a combination of nameservers that begin with `https://` and that do not
      begin with `https://` is not supported. If servers are specified with `https://`
      one of `ca_certificate` and `ca_certificate_group` parameters must be set.
