    client_name:
      description: The client name portion of the client-visible snapshot name. A
        full snapshot name is constructed in the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`
        where `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the value of this
        field, and `SUFFIX` is the suffix. The client-visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`.
        The client name of a directory snapshot managed by a snapshot policy is not
        changeable. If the `name` and `client_name` parameters are both specified,
        `client_name` must match the client name portion of `name`.

        `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the client name, and
        `SUFFIX` is the value of this field. The client-visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`.
        The suffix of a directory snapshot managed by a snapshot policy is not changeable.
        If the `name` and `suffix` parameters are both specified, `suffix` must match
        the suffix portion of `name`.
