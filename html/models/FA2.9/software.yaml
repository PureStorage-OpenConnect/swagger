    status:
      description: The status of the software package. Valid values are `available`,
        `downloaded`, `downloading`, `download_failed`, `checking`, `installing`,
        `new`, `paused`, `aborting`, `abort`, `canceled`, `partially_installed`, and
        `installed`. A status of `available` indicates that the package is available
        for download. This only applies if `automatic-download` is not enabled. A
        status of `downloaded` indicates that the package is downloaded and ready
        for installation. A status of `downloading` indicates that the package is
        currently downloading. A status of `download_failed` indicates that the download
        of the package failed. A status of `checking` indicates that the package is
        currently running in `check-only` mode. A status of `installing` indicates
        that the package is currently installing. A status of `new` indicates that
        Pure1 cloud is still building the package. A status of `paused` indicates
        that the upgrade is paused and waiting for user input to proceed. A status
        of `aborting` indicates that the upgrade is being aborted, due to an unrecoverable
        error or an `abort` command issued by the user. A status of `canceled` indicates
        that the upgrade has been canceled. A status of `partially_installed` indicates
        that the upgrade has been partially installed due to an `abort`. The array
        has been upgraded to an intermediate version and the `software` is no longer
        available for installation. A status of `installed` indicates that the upgrade
        has finished.
