    promotion_status:
      description: Current promotion status of a volume. Valid values are `promoted`
        and `demoted`. A status of `promoted` indicates that the volume has been promoted
        and can accept write requests from hosts. This is the default status for a
        volume when it is created. A status of `demoted` indicates that the volume
        has been demoted and no longer accepts write requests.

    requested_promotion_state:
      description: Valid values are `promoted` and `demoted`. Patch `requested_promotion_state`
        to `demoted` to demote the volume so that the volume stops accepting write
        requests. Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `promoted` to promote the volume
        so that the volume starts accepting write requests.
