    suffix:
      description: The snapshot suffix name. A full snapshot name is constructed in
        the form of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the managed directory
        name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the snapshot client name, and `SUFFIX` is the snapshot
        suffix. The client-visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`. The `suffix`
        value can only be set for one rule in the same policy. The `suffix` value
        can only be set on a rule with the same `keep_for` value and `every` value.
        The `suffix` value can only be set on the rule with the largest `keep_for`
        value. If not specified, defaults to a monotonically increasing number generated
        by the system.
