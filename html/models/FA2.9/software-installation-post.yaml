properties:
  mode:
    description: Mode that the upgrade is in. Valid values are `check-only`, `interactive`,
      `semi-interactive`, and `one-click`. The `check_only` mode is deprecated. Use
      `/software-checks`. In this mode, the upgrade only runs pre-upgrade checks and
      returns. In `interactive` mode, the upgrade pauses at several points, at which
      users must enter certain commands to proceed. In `semi-interactive` mode, the
      upgrade pauses if there are any upgrade check failures and functions like `one-click`
      mode otherwise. In `one-click` mode, the upgrade proceeds automatically without
      pausing.

  override_checks:
    description: A list of upgrade checks whose failures are overridden during the
      upgrade. If any optional `args` are provided, they are validated later when
      the corresponding check script runs.
