      description: Returns a value of `true` if the volume has been destroyed and

        time left until the destroyed volume is permanently eradicated. Before the
        `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed volume can be recovered
        by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed,
        the volume is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
