        where `DIR` is the full managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME` is the client
        name, and `SUFFIX` is the suffix. The client-visible snapshot name is `CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX`.

      description: Returns a value of `true` if the snapshot has been destroyed and
        is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of
        time left until the destroyed directory snapshot is permanently eradicated.
        Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed directory snapshot
        can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period
        has elapsed, the directory snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer
        be recovered.

        of `DIR.CLIENT_NAME.SUFFIX` where `DIR` is the managed directory name, `CLIENT_NAME`
        is the client name, and `SUFFIX` is the suffix. If the suffix is a string,
        this field returns `null`. See the `name` value for the full snapshot name
        including the suffix.

        is destroyed, by setting `policy=""` if it is managed by a snapshot policy,
        or by setting `keep_for=""` if it is a manual snapshot.
