      description: If set to `true`, the realm will be destroyed and pending eradication.
        The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time left until the destroyed
        realm is permanently eradicated. A realm can only be destroyed if it is empty
        or destroy_contents is set to true. Before the `time_remaining` period has
        elapsed, the destroyed realm can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`.
        Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the realm is permanently eradicated
        and can no longer be recovered.
