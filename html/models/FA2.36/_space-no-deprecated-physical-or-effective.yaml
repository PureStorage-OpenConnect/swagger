    data_reduction:
      description: The ratio of mapped sectors within a volume versus the amount of
        physical space the data occupies after data compression and deduplication.
        The data reduction ratio does not include thin provisioning savings. For example,
        a data reduction ratio of 5&#58;1 means that for every 5 MB the host writes
        to the array, 1 MB is stored on the array's flash modules.
      type: number
      format: float
    shared:
      description: The physical space occupied by deduplicated data, meaning that
        the space is shared with other volumes and snapshots as a result of data deduplication,
        measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
        by data that is not unique to a specific volume, managed directory, or snapshot,
        measured in bytes.

    snapshots:
      description: The physical space occupied by data unique to one or more snapshots,
        measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
        by data unique to one or more snapshots, measured in bytes.

    system:
      description: The physical space occupied by internal array metadata, measured
        in bytes.

      minimum: 0
    thin_provisioning:
      description: The percentage of volume sectors that do not contain host-written
        data because the hosts have not written data to them or the sectors have been
        explicitly trimmed.
      type: number
      format: float
      minimum: 0.0
      maximum: 1.0
    total_reduction:
      description: The ratio of provisioned sectors within a volume versus the amount
        of physical space the data occupies after reduction via data compression and
        deduplication and with thin provisioning savings. Total reduction is data
        reduction with thin provisioning savings. For example, a total reduction ratio
        of 10&#58;1 means that for every 10 MB of provisioned space, 1 MB is stored
        on the array's flash modules.
      type: number
      format: float
    unique:
      description: The unique physical space occupied by customer data. Unique physical
        space does not include shared space, snapshots, and internal array metadata.
        Measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
        by unique customer data, measured in bytes. Unique data does not include shared
        space, snapshots, and internal array metadata.

    virtual:
      description: The amount of logically written data that a volume or a snapshot
        references, measured in bytes.
      type: integer
      format: int64
      minimum: 0
    total_provisioned:
      description: The provisioned size of a volume for a single volume, host or host
        group, protocol endpoint, managed directory, and containers can be infinite
        or measured in bytes. Infinite is represented by `null`. The provisioned size
        for a host or host group, includes all volumes that are connected to the resource.
        The provisioned size for a protocol endpoint is `null'. The provisioned size
        for a managed directory is the quota limit if it or its parent has a managed
        directory configured, otherwise it defaults to `null`. The provisioned size
        for a container is the sum of the total_provisioned of the object it contains,
        capped by the container's quota limit (or the container's used_provisioned
        if current usage is above the quota limit), if any. Provisioned size represents
        the storage capacity reported to hosts.

    used_provisioned:
      description: The amount of logical space a container has consumed. The amount
        of logical space is compared against the quota limit if the container has
        one configured. Used provisioned does not include destroyed objects inside
        the container. For a destroyed container, used provisioned can include destroyed
        objects and represents how much logical space it would take to recover the
        container.

    footprint:
      description: The maximum amount of physical space the container would take up
        on any array, ignoring any data shared outside the container. Measured in
        bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the maximum amount of effective used
        space, measured in bytes. The footprint metric is mostly used for capacity
        planning. This field will be null in non-container contexts.
