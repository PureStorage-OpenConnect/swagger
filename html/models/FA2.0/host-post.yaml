    personality:
      description: Determines how the system tunes the array to ensure that it works
        optimally with the host. Set `personality` to the name of the host operating
        system or virtual memory system. Valid values are `aix`, `esxi`, `hitachi-vsp`,
        `hpux`, `oracle-vm-server`, `solaris`, and `vms`. If your system is not listed
        as one of the valid host personalities, do not set the option. By default,
        the personality is not set.

    preferred_arrays:
      description: For synchronous replication configurations, sets a host's preferred
        array to specify which array exposes active/optimized paths to that host.
        Enter multiple preferred arrays in comma-separated format. If a preferred
        array is set for a host, then the other arrays in the same pod will expose
        active/non-optimized paths to that host. If the host is in a host group, `preferred_arrays`
        cannot be set because host groups have their own preferred arrays. On a preferred
        array of a certain host, all the paths on all the ports (for both the primary
        and secondary controllers) are set up as A/O (active/optimized) paths, while
        on a non-preferred array, all the paths are A/N (Active/Non-optimized) paths.
