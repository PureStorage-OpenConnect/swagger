    type: integer
    description: The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are to
      address the specified volume. If the LUN is not specified, the system automatically
      assigns a LUN to the connection. To automatically assign a LUN to a private
      connection, the system starts at LUN `1` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`,
      assigning the first available LUN to the connection. For shared connections,
      the system starts at LUN `254` and counts down to the minimum LUN `1`, assigning
      the first available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the `[1...254]` range
      are taken, the system starts at LUN `255` and counts up to the maximum LUN `4095`,
      assigning the first available LUN to the connection.

  protocol_endpoint:
    description: A protocol endpoint (also known as a conglomerate volume) which acts
      as a proxy through which virtual volumes are created and then connected to VMware
      ESXi hosts or host groups. The protocol endpoint itself does not serve I/Os;
      instead, its job is to form connections between FlashArray volumes and ESXi
      hosts and host groups.
