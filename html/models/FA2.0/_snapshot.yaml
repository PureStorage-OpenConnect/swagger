  created:
    description: The snapshot creation time. Measured in milliseconds since the UNIX
      epoch.
    type: integer

    readOnly: true
  destroyed:
    description: Returns a value of `true` if the snapshot has been destroyed and
      is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time
      left until the destroyed volume snapshot is permanently eradicated. Before the
      `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed volume snapshot can be recovered
      by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed,
      the volume snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.

  suffix:
    description: The suffix that is appended to the `source_name` value to generate
      the full volume snapshot name in the form `VOL.SUFFIX`. If the suffix is not
      specified, the system constructs the snapshot name in the form `VOL.NNN`, where
      `VOL` is the volume name, and `NNN` is a monotonically increasing number.
