  data_reduction:
    description: The ratio of mapped sectors within a volume versus the amount of
      physical space the data occupies after data compression and deduplication. The
      data reduction ratio does not include thin provisioning savings. For example,
      a data reduction ratio of 5&#58;1 means that for every 5 MB the host writes
      to the array, 1 MB is stored on the array's flash modules.
    type: number
    format: float
  shared:
    description: The physical space occupied by deduplicated data, meaning that the
      space is shared with other volumes and snapshots as a result of data deduplication.
      Measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
      by data that is not unique to a specific volume, managed directory, or snapshot,
      measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    example: 111863360624
  snapshots:
    description: The physical space occupied by data unique to one or more snapshots.
      Measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
      by data unique to one or more snapshots, measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  system:
    description: The physical space occupied by internal array metadata. Measured
      in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  thin_provisioning:
    description: The percentage of volume sectors that do not contain host-written
      data because the hosts have not written data to them or the sectors have been
      explicitly trimmed.
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0.0
    maximum: 1.0
  total_physical:
    description: The total physical space occupied by system, shared space, volume,
      and snapshot data. Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  total_provisioned:
    description: For a single volume, the provisioned size of the volume. For all
      other resources, the total provisioned size of all volumes that are connected
      to or are inside the resource. Represents storage capacity reported to hosts.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0

  total_reduction:
    description: The ratio of provisioned sectors within a volume versus the amount
      of physical space the data occupies after reduction via data compression and
      deduplication and with thin provisioning savings. Total reduction is data reduction
      with thin provisioning savings. For example, a total reduction ratio of 10&#58;1
      means that for every 10 MB of provisioned space, 1 MB is stored on the array's
      flash modules.
    type: number
    format: float
  unique:
    description: The unique physical space occupied by customer data. Unique physical
      space does not include shared space, snapshots, and internal array metadata.
      Measured in bytes. On Evergreen//One arrays, this is the effective space contributed
      by unique customer data, measured in bytes. Unique data does not include shared
      space, snapshots, and internal array metadata.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  virtual:
    description: The amount of logically written data that a volume or a snapshot
      references. Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
