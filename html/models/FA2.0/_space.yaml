  data_reduction:
    description: >-
      The ratio of mapped sectors within a volume versus
      the amount of physical space the data occupies after data compression and deduplication.
      The data reduction ratio does not include thin provisioning savings.
      For example, a data reduction ratio of 5&#58;1 means that
      for every 5 MB the host writes to the array, 1 MB is stored on the array's flash modules.
    type: number
    format: float
  shared:
    description: >-
      The physical space occupied by deduplicated data, meaning that the space is shared with other
      volumes and snapshots as a result of data deduplication.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    example: 111863360624
  snapshots:
    description: >-
      The physical space occupied by data unique to one or more snapshots.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  system:
    description: >-
      The physical space occupied by internal array metadata. Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  thin_provisioning:
    description: >-
      The percentage of volume sectors that do not contain host-written data
      because the hosts have not written data to them or the sectors have been explicitly trimmed.
    type: number
    format: float
    minimum: 0.0
    maximum: 1.0
  total_physical:
    description: >-
      The total physical space occupied by system, shared space, volume, and snapshot data.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  total_provisioned:
    description: >-
      For a single volume, the provisioned size of the volume.
      For all other resources, the total provisioned size of all volumes
      that are connected to or are inside the resource.
      Represents storage capacity reported to hosts.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    example: 19937690345472
  total_reduction:
    description: >-
      The ratio of provisioned sectors within a volume versus
      the amount of physical space the data occupies
      after reduction via data compression and deduplication
      and with thin provisioning savings.
      Total reduction is data reduction with thin provisioning savings.
      For example, a total reduction ratio of 10&#58;1 means that
      for every 10 MB of provisioned space,
      1 MB is stored on the array's flash modules.

    type: number
    format: float
  unique:
    description: >-
      The unique physical space occupied by customer data.
      Unique physical space does not include shared space, snapshots, and internal array metadata.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
  virtual:
    description: >-
      The amount of logically written data that a volume or a snapshot references.
      Measured in bytes.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
