  lun:
    type: integer
    description: 'The logical unit number (LUN) by which the specified hosts are to
      address the specified volume. LUN can be in one of two formats: a simple LUN,
      or a LUN and Sublun with virtual volumes. A LUN and Sublun are integers in the
      range of 1 to 4095.

      The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single int64
      combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).

      In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun". Example:
      LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2 Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.
      In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.

      To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts at
      LUN ''1'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the first available
      LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts at LUN ''254''
      and counts down to the minimum LUN ''1'', assigning the first available LUN
      to the connection. If all LUNs in the ''[1...254]'' range are taken, the system
      starts at LUN ''255'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the
      first available LUN to the connection. The maximum int64 LUN:Sublun value is
      17587891081215.'

  protocol_endpoint:
    description: A protocol endpoint (also known as a conglomerate volume) which acts
      as a proxy through which virtual volumes are created and then connected to VMware
      ESXi hosts or host groups. The protocol endpoint itself does not serve I/Os;
      instead, its job is to form connections between FlashArray volumes and ESXi
      hosts and host groups.
