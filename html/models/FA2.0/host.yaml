        Determines how the system tunes the array to ensure that it works optimally with the host.
        Set `personality` to the name of the host operating system or virtual memory system.
        Valid values are `aix`, `esxi`, `hitachi-vsp`, `hpux`,
        `oracle-vm-server`, `solaris`, and `vms`.
        If your system is not listed as one of the valid host personalities, do not set the option.
        By default, the personality is not set.

    preferred_arrays:
      description: >-
        For synchronous replication configurations, sets a host's preferred array to specify which
        array exposes active/optimized paths to that host.
        Enter multiple preferred arrays in comma-separated format.
        If a preferred array is set for a host,
        then the other arrays in the same pod will expose active/non-optimized paths to that host.
        If the host is in a host group, `preferred_arrays` cannot be set because host groups
        have their own preferred arrays.
        On a preferred array of a certain host, all the paths on all the ports
        (for both the primary and secondary controllers) are set up as A/O (active/optimized) paths,
        while on a non-preferred array, all the paths are A/N (Active/Non-optimized) paths.
