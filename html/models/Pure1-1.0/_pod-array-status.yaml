    frozen_at:
      description: The Unix timestamp of when the array was last in sync with the
        pod (or null if the array is currently in sync).
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 1502729489760
    mediator_status:
      description: The status of the mediator as assessed by this array. Valid values
        are `flummoxed`, `online`, `unknown`, and `unreachable`. `flummoxed` - The
        array has the wrong UUID for the mediator. This means that the array can reach
        a mediator, but is talking to the wrong one. Typically, this would be due
        to a misconfiguration in the customer environment (e.g. DNS misconfiguration).
        UUIDs also have a TTL. If a pod goes offline on one array, and stays like
        that for weeks (such that the TTL expires), it may also show this status until
        the peer array is reachable again. `online` - The array is successfully communicating
        with the mediator. `unreachable` - The array cannot reach the mediator. This
        could be due to a network issue or the mediator is down.
      type: string
      example: online
    status:
      description: Status of an array in the pod. Valid values are `offline`, `online`,
        `resyncing`, and `unknown`. `offline` - There is a problem. This array cannot
        confirm it has the latest data for this pod. This array can not handle IO
        to the pod nor could it take over during an HA event. `online` - Everything
        is fine. This array has the latest data for this pod. This array can handle
        IO to the pod and can take over during an HA event. `resyncing` - There was
        a problem. This array is actively catching up to get the latest data for this
        pod. This array can handle IO to this pod's volumes, however it could not
        take over during an HA event. `unknown` - The state of the pod on this array
        cannot be determined. This state is only seen on disconnected arrays. The
        disconnected array cannot determine if the pod on another array is online
        or offline.
