    data:
      description: The data points of the metric corresponding to the time window,
        resolution and aggregation. The points are returned in a nested array of 2-element
        arrays. For each of the 2-element array, the 1st element is the UTC millisecond
        epoch, and the 2nd element is the value, e.g. [[1519362000000, 11], [1519362030000,
        21], ...].
