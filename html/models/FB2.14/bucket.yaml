      description: Status of the `time_remaining` field. `calculating` means the bucket

        has been destroyed and will never be eradicated, because an object with legal
        hold status was found inside. null otherwise, i.e. when either the bucket
        is not destroyed or it's destroyed and the `time_remaining` has been determined.
