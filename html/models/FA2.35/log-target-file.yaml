      description: Specifies the period that audit logs are retained before they are
        deleted, in milliseconds. If not specified, defaults to `null` which means
        size based retention does not apply. Use 0 to reset the value to `null`. At
        least one of the `keep_for` or `keep_size` parameters are required, and they
        can be set together.
