    requested_promotion_state:
      type: string
      description: Valid values are `promoted` and `demoted`. Patch `requested_promotion_state`
        to `demoted` to demote the pod so that it can be used as a link target for
        continuous replication between pods. Demoted pods do not accept write requests,
        and a destroyed version of the pod with `undo-demote` appended to the pod
        name is created on the array with the state of the pod when it was in the
        promoted state. Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `promoted` to start the
        process of promoting the pod. The `promotion_status` indicates when the pod
        has been successfully promoted. Promoted pods stop incorporating replicated
        data from the source pod and start accepting write requests. The replication
        process does not stop as the source pod continues replicating data to the
        pod. The space consumed by the unique replicated data is tracked by the `space.journal`
        field of the pod.
    promotion_status:
      type: string
      description: Current promotion status of a pod. Valid values are `promoted`,
        `demoted`, and `promoting`. The `promoted` status indicates that the pod has
        been promoted. The pod takes writes from hosts instead of incorporating replicated
        data. This is the default mode for a pod when it is created. The `demoted`
        status indicates that the pod has been demoted. The pod does not accept write
        requests and is ready to be used as a link target. The `promoting` status
        indicates that the pod is in an intermediate status between `demoted` and
        `promoted` while the promotion process is taking place.
    link_source_count:
      type: integer
      description: Number of source pods that link to the pod.
      example: 1
    link_target_count:
      type: integer
      description: Number of target pods that link to the pod.
      example: 1
