    description: Which mode the upgrade is in. Valid values are `interactive`, `one_click`,
      and `check_only`. In `interactive` mode, the upgrade process pauses at several
      points, at which users must enter certain commands to proceed. In `one_click`
      mode, the upgrade proceeds automatically without pausing. In `check_only` mode,
      the upgrade only runs pre-upgrade checks and returns.
