    description: The name of the upgrade check to be overridden so the software upgrade
      can continue if the check failed or is anticipated to fail during the upgrade
      process. Overriding the check forces the system to ignore the check failure
      and continue with the upgrade. If the check includes more specific checks that
      failed or are anticipated to fail, set them using the `args` parameter. For
      example, the HostIOCheck check may include a list of hosts that have failed
      or are anticipated to fail the upgrade check.
    type: string
    example: HostIOCheck
  args:
    description: The name of the specific check within the override check to ignore
      so that the system can continue with the software upgrade. The `name` parameter
      of the override check must be specified with the `args` parameter. For example,
      if the HostIOCheck check fails on hosts host01 and host02, the system displays
      a list of these host names in the failed check. To override the HostIOCheck
      checks for host01 and host02, set `name=HostIOCheck`, and set `args=host01,host02`.
      Enter multiple `args` in comma-separated format. Note that not all checks have
      `args` values.
    type: string
    example: host1,host2,host3
  persistent:
    description: 'If set to `true`, the system always ignores the failure of the specified
      upgrade check and continues with the upgrade process.

      If set to `false`, the system ignores the failure of the specified upgrade check
      until the upgrade check finishes and the upgrade process is continued. For example,
      the `continue` command is successfully issued in an `interactive` mode, or the
      first upgrade check step successfully finishes in a `one_click` mode.'
