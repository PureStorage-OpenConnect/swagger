      description: Patch `requested_promotion_state` to `demoted` to demote the pod
        so that it can be used as a link target for continuous replication between
        pods. Demoted pods do not accept write requests, and a destroyed version of
        the pod with `undo-demote` appended to the pod name is created on the array
        with the state of the pod when it was in the promoted state. Patch `requested_promotion_state`
        to `promoted` to start the process of promoting the pod. The `promotion_status`
        indicates when the pod has been successfully promoted. Promoted pods stop
        incorporating replicated data from the source pod and start accepting write
        requests. The replication process does not stop when the source pod continues
        replicating data to the pod. The space consumed by the unique replicated data
        is tracked by the `space.journal` field of the pod.
