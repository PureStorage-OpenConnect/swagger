    status:
      description: The status of the software package. Valid values are `available`,
        `downloaded`, `downloading`, `download_failed`, `checking`, `installing`,
        `paused`, `aborting`, `abort`, `canceled`, `partially_installed`, and `installed`.
        A status of `available` indicates that the package is available for download.
        This only applies if `automatic-download` is not enabled. A status of `downloaded`
        indicates that the package is downloaded and ready for installation. A status
        of `downloading` indicates that the package is currently downloading. A status
        of `download_failed` indicates that the download of the package failed. A
        status of `checking` indicates that the package is currently running in `check-only`
        mode. A status of `installing` indicates that the package is currently installing.
        A status of `paused` indicates that the upgrade is paused and waiting for
        user input to proceed. A status of `aborting` indicates that the upgrade is
        being aborted, due to an unrecoverable error or an `abort` command issued
        by the user. A status of `canceled` indicates that the upgrade has been canceled.
        A status of `partially_installed` indicates that the upgrade has been partially
        installed due to an `abort`. The array has been upgraded to an intermediate
        version and the `software` is no longer available for installation. A status
        of `installed` indicates that the upgrade has finished.
