description: 'A built-in resource. Many are singletons predefined by Purity (e.g.,
  support settings). Some correspond to a piece of software, like an app, or hardware,
  like a controller. Others are created by the system in response to some event (e.g.,
  alerts, audit records).

  Typically, a user can''t create, delete or rename a built-in resource. A few can
  be created or deleted, but not renamed because the names are meaningful to Purity
  (e.g., VIFs, file systems, file system snapshots, volume snapshot).'
