    access:
      description: Specifies access control for the export. Valid values are `root-squash`,
        `all-squash`, and `no-squash`. `root-squash` prevents client users and groups
        with root privilege from mapping their root privilege to a file system. All
        users with UID 0 will have their UID mapped to anonuid. All users with GID
        0 will have their GID mapped to anongid. `all-squash` maps all UIDs (including
        root) to anonuid and all GIDs (including root) to anongid. `no-squash` allows
        users and groups to access the file system with their UIDs and GIDs. The default
        is `root-squash` if not specified.
      type: string
    anongid:
      description: Any user whose GID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
        or `all_squash` will have their GID mapped to `anongid`. The default `anongid`
        is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear.
      example: 65530
      type: string
    anonuid:
      description: Any user whose UID is affected by an `access` of `root_squash`
        or `all_squash` will have their UID mapped to `anonuid`. The default `anonuid`
        is null, which means 65534. Use "" to clear.
      example: 65530
      type: string
    atime:
      description: 'If `true`, after a read operation has occurred, the inode access
        time is updated only if any of the following conditions is true: the previous
        access time is less than the inode modify time, the previous access time is
        less than the inode change time, or the previous access time is more than
        24 hours ago. If `false`, disables the update of inode access times after
        read operations. Defaults to `true`.'
      type: boolean
    client:
      description: Specifies the clients that will be permitted to access the export.
        Accepted notation is a single IP address, subnet in CIDR notation, netgroup,
        or anonymous (`*`). The default is `*` if not specified.
      type: string
    fileid_32bit:
      description: Whether the file id is 32 bits or not. Defaults to `false`.
      type: boolean
    permission:
      description: Specifies which read-write client access permissions are allowed
        for the export. Valid values are `rw` and `ro`. The default is `ro` if not
        specified.
      type: string
    policy:
      allOf:
      - $ref: ../../models/FB2.0/_fixed-reference.yaml
      description: The policy to which this rule belongs.
      readOnly: true
    policy_version:
      description: The policy's version. This can be used when updating the resource
        to ensure there aren't any updates to the policy since the resource was read.
      readOnly: true
      type: string
    secure:
      description: If `true`, prevents NFS access to client connections coming from
        non-reserved ports. Applies to NFSv3, NFSv4.1, and auxiliary protocols MOUNT
        and NLM. If `false`, allows NFS access to client connections coming from non-reserved
        ports. Applies to NFSv3, NFSv4.1, and auxiliary protocols MOUNT and NLM. The
        default is `false` if not specified.
      type: boolean
    security:
      description: The security flavors to use for accessing files on this mount point.  If
        the server does not support the requested flavor, the mount operation fails.
        If `sys`, trusts the client to specify user's identity. If `krb5`, provides
        cryptographic proof of a user's identity in each RPC request. This provides  strong
        verification of the identity of users accessing data on the server. Note that
        additional configuration besides adding this mount option is required in order
        to enable Kerberos security. If `krb5i`, adds integrity checking to krb5,
        to ensure the data has not been tampered with. If `krb5p`, adds integrity
        checking and encryption to krb5. This is the most secure setting, but it also
        involves the most performance overhead. The default is `sys` if not specified.
