    max_role:
      description: The maximum role allowed for ID Tokens issued by this API client.
        The bearer of an access token will be authorized to perform actions within
        the intersection of this `max_role` and the role of the array user specified
        as the JWT `sub` (subject) claim. The `max_role` field is a reference to a
        `role`. Valid `role`s are `readonly`, `ops_admin`, `array_admin`, and `storage_admin`.
        Users with the `readonly` (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey
        the state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array.
        Users with the `ops_admin` (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations
        as Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops
        Admin users cannot alter the state of the array. Users with the `storage_admin`
        (Storage Admin) role can perform the same operations as Read Only users plus
        storage related operations, such as administering file systems, snapshots,
        and buckets. Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with
        global and system configurations. Users with the `array_admin` (Array Admin)
        role can perform the same operations as Storage Admin users plus array-wide
        changes dealing with global and system configurations. In other words, Array
        Admin users can perform all operations.
