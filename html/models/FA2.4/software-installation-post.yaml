  mode:
    description: Mode the upgrade is in. Valid values are `check-only`, `interactive`,
      `semi-interactive`, and `one-click`. In `check-only` mode, the upgrade only
      runs pre-upgrade checks and returns. In `interactive` mode, the upgrade process
      pauses at several points, at which users must enter certain commands to proceed.
      In `semi-interactive` mode, the upgrade pauses if there are any upgrade check
      failures and functions like `one-click` mode otherwise. In `one-click` mode,
      the upgrade proceeds automatically without pausing.

  override_checks:
    description: A list of upgrade checks whose failure is overridden during the upgrade.
      If any optional `args` are provided, they are validated later when the corresponding
      check script runs.
