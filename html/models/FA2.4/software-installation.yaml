    mode:
      description: Mode that the upgrade is in. Valid values are `check-only`, `interactive`,
        `semi-interactive`, and `one-click`. In `check-only` mode, the upgrade only
        runs pre-upgrade checks and returns. In `interactive` mode, the upgrade process
        pauses at several points, at which users must enter certain commands to proceed.
        In `semi-interactive` mode, the upgrade pauses if there are any upgrade check
        failures, and functions like `one-click` mode otherwise. In `one-click` mode,
        the upgrade proceeds automatically without pausing.

      description: Status of the upgrade. Valid values are `installing`, `paused`,
        `aborting`, `aborted`, and `finished`. A status of `installing` indicates
        that the upgrade is running. A status of `paused` indicates that the upgrade
        is paused and waiting for user input. A status of `aborting` indicates that
        the upgrade is being aborted. A status of `aborted` indicates that the upgrade
        has stopped due to an abort. A status of `finished` indicates that the upgrade
        has finished successfully.
