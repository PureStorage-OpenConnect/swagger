    management_address:
      description: Management IP address or FQDN of the target array.
      type: string
      example: 10.202.101.78
    replication_addresses:
      description: IP addresses of the target arrays when `replication_transport`
        is `ip`. WWNs of the target arrays when `replication_transport` is `fc`.

        type: string
        example: 10.202.101.70
    status:
      description: Status of the connection. Valid values are `connected`, `connecting`,
        `partially_connected`, and `unbalanced`. A status of `connected` indicates
        that arrays are communicating. A status of `connecting` indicates that the
        array is trying to establish a connection. A status of `partially_connected`
        indicates that some replication addresses are communicating but others are
        not. A status of `unbalanced` indicates that the arrays are communicating,
        but the set of paths is either not redundant or not symmetric.
      type: string
    type:
      description: The type of replication. Valid values are `async-replication` and
        `sync-replication`.

    replication_transport:
      description: The protocol used to transport data between the local array and
        the remote array. Valid values are `ip` and `fc`. The default is `ip`.
      type: string
