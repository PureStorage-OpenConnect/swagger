    suffix:
      description: Specifies a name suffix for the snapshots created. The snapshot
        is created on the FlashArray specified by the `on` parameter. The `on` parameter
        cannot refer to an offload target. Snapshots with suffixes specified have
        names in the form `PGROUP.SUFFIX` instead of the default `PGROUP.NNN` form.
        The names of all snapshots created by a single command that specifies this
        option have the same suffix.
