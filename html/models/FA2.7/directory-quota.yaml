  enforced:
    description: Defines whether the quota rule is enforced or unenforced. If the
      quota rule is enforced and logical space usage exceeds the quota limit, any
      modification operations that result in a need for more space are blocked. If
      the quota rule is unenforced and logical space usage exceeds the quota limit,
      notification emails are sent to targets that are specified using the `notification`
      parameter. No client operations are blocked when an unenforced limit is exceeded.
      If set to `true`, the limit is enforced. If set to `false`, notification targets
      are informed when the usage exceeds 80 percent of the limit.
