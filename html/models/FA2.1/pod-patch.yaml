    destroyed:
      description: If set to `true`, the pod has been destroyed and is pending eradication.
        The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time left until the destroyed
        pod is permanently eradicated. A pod can only be destroyed if it is empty,
        so before destroying a pod, ensure all volumes and protection groups inside
        the pod have been either moved out of the pod or destroyed. A stretched pod
        cannot be destroyed unless you unstretch it first. Before the `time_remaining`
        period has elapsed, the destroyed pod can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`.
        Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the pod is permanently eradicated
        and can no longer be recovered.

    failover_preferences:
      description: Determines which array within a stretched pod should be given priority
        to stay online should the arrays ever lose contact with each other. The current
        array and any peer arrays that are connected to the current array for synchronous
        replication can be added to a pod for failover preference. By default, `failover_preferences=null`,
        meaning no arrays have been configured for failover preference. Enter multiple
        arrays in comma-separated format.

        serves as the mediator.
