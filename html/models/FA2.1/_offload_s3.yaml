type: object
properties:
  access_key_id:
    type: string
    description: The access key ID of the AWS account used to create a connection
      between the array and an Amazon S3 offload target. The access key ID is 20 characters
      in length and is only accepted when creating the connection between the array
      and the S3 offload target. The `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, and `bucket`
      parameters must be set together.
  bucket:
    type: string
    description: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to where the data will be offloaded.
      Grant basic read and write ACL permissions to the bucket, and enable default
      (server-side) encryption for the bucket. Also verify that the bucket is empty
      of all objects and does not have any lifecycle policies. The `access_key_id`,
      `secret_access_key`, and `bucket` parameters must be set together.
  placement_strategy:
    type: string
    description: The storage placement strategy used for the dynamic placement of
      data in an Amazon S3 offload target. Valid values are `aws-intelligent-tiering`,
      `aws-standard-class`, and `retention-based`. If set to `aws-intelligent-tiering`,
      data is stored in the Amazon S3 INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class regardless
      of the retention period. If set to `aws-standard-access`, the data is stored
      in the Amazon S3 STANDARD storage class regardless of the retention period.
      If set to `retention-based`, the data for protection groups with longer retention
      periods is placed in the Amazon S3 STANDARD_IA (infrequently accessed, more
      cost-effective) storage class. All other data is placed in the STANDARD storage
      class. When the array is initially connected to an S3 offload target, `placement_strategy`
      is automatically set to `retention-based`. The `placement_strategy` or `uri`
      parameter is required, but they cannot be set together.
  secret_access_key:
    type: string
    description: The secret access key that goes with the access key ID (`access_key_id`)
      of the AWS account. The secret access key is 40 characters in length is only
      accepted when creating the connection between the array and the S3 offload target.
      The `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, and `bucket` parameters must be set
      together.
  uri:
    type: string
    description: The URI used to create a connection between the array and a non-AWS
      S3 offload target. Storage placement strategies are not supported for non-AWS
      S3 offload targets. Both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols are allowed.
    Example: http://arrayname:port/
