    frozen_at:
      description: The timestamp of when the data on the pod was frozen when the array
        went offline. Measured in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. Also known as
        the recovery point. If the pod is in sync, a value of `null` will be returned.
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 1492662000
    mediator_status:
      description: The status of the mediator, which determines whether it is available
        to mediate a high availability event. Valid values are `flummoxed`, `online`,
        `unknown`, and `unreachable`. Only mediators in the `online` status can mediate
        high availability events. If set to `flummoxed`, the array can reach a mediator,
        but it is talking to the wrong one. Verify that the DNS in the environment
        is properly configured. This status might also appear if the pod has been
        offline on one array for an extended period of time and the peer array is
        unreachable. If set to `online`, the array is successfully communicating with
        the mediator, and the mediator is available to mediate a high availability
        event. If set to `unreachable`, the array cannot reach the mediator, either
        due to network issues or because the mediator is down. When a mediator is
        unreachable, synchronous replication continues to function provided all arrays
        are healthy and communicating, but a high availability event without mediator
        access can result in an outage.
      type: string
    pre_elected:
      description: If set to `true`, the array has been pre-elected to remain online
        in the rare event that the mediator is inaccessible on both arrays within
        the stretched pod, and then later, the arrays within the stretched pod become
        disconnected from each other. If set to `false`, either the array has been
        pre-elected to remain offline while its peer array remains online, or pre-election
        is not in effect. One and only one array within each pod is pre-elected at
        a given point in time, so while a pre-elected array is keeping the pod online,
        the pod on its non-elected peer array remains offline during the communication
        failure. Users cannot pre-elect arrays.
      type: boolean
    progress:
      description: The percentage progress of the pod resyncing process for this array.
        The percentage is displayed as a decimal value, starting at 0.00 and ending
        at 1.00.
      type: number
      format: float
      min: 0.0
      max: 1.0
      example: 0.66
    status:
      description: The status of the array within the stretched pod. Valid values
        are `offline`, `online`, `resyncing`, `suspended`, and `unknown`. If set to
        `offline`, the array is experiencing problems and may not have the latest
        pod data. The array cannot handle I/O to the pod and cannot take over during
        a high availability event. If set to `online`, the array is online and has
        the latest pod data. The array can handle I/O to the pod and take over during
        a high availability event. If set to `suspended`, the array is experiencing
        a short connection glitch of the pod. This is a temporary status and would
        transition to either `online` or `offline` soon. `suspended` is a new status
        that is exposed, starting from version 6.6.0. If set to `resyncing`, the array
        is actively getting the latest pod data so that it becomes fully synchronized
        with its peer array. During the resyncing process, the array cannot handle
        I/O to the pod. Once the arrays are fully synchronized, the array changes
        to `online` status. If set to `unknown`, the status of the peer array is unknown
        because this array is offline and cannot determine the state of the pod on
        the peer array. Only the peer array can ever be in unknown status; this unknown
        status is unique to the local array and will differ when viewed from its peer
        array.
