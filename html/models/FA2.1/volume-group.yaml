    destroyed:
      description: Returns a value of `true` if the volume group has been destroyed
        and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount
        of time left until the destroyed volume group is permanently eradicated. Before
        the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed volume group can be
        recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period has
        elapsed, the volume group is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
