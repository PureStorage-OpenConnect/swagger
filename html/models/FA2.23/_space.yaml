    total_provisioned:
      description: The provisioned size of a volume for a single volume, host or host
        group, protocol endpoint, managed directory, and containers can be infinite
        or measured in bytes. Infinite is represented by `null`. The provisioned size
        for a host or host group, includes all volumes that are connected to the resource.
        The provisioned size for a protocol endpoint is `null'. The provisioned size
        for a managed directory is the quota limit if it or its parent has a managed
        directory configured, otherwise it is `null`. The provisioned size for a container
        is the sum of the total_provisioned of the object it contains, capped by the
        container's quota limit (or the container's used_provisioned if current usage
        is above the quota limit), if any. Provisioned size represents storage capacity
        reported to hosts.

    used_provisioned:
      description: The amount of logical space a container has consumed. The number
        is compared against the quota limit if the container has one one configured.
        Used provisioned does not include destroyed objects inside the container.
        For a destroyed container, used provisioned can include destroyed objects
        and represents how much logical space it would take to recover the container.
