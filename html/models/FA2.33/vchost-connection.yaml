    description: For vchost-connections, a vchost represents a vCenter. By connecting
      to a protocol endpoint, the corresponding vCenter gets the access to the storage
      container represented by this protocol endpoint. The vchost name should be null
      if `all_vchosts` is set to `true`, which means the storage container is accessible
      to all vchosts.

    type: boolean
    description: If set to `true`, the storage container represented by the protocol
      endpoint is accessible to all vchosts. If set to `false`, the storage container
      represented by the protocol endpoint is only accesible to the vchosts that have
      explicit vchost-connections to this protocol endpoint. The default is `false`.
