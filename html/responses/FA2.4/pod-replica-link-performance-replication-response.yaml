    description: The aggregate value of all items after filtering. For real-time performance,
      the values are aggregated for the latest timestamp. For historical performance,
      the values are aggregated for each timestamp from `start_time` to `end_time`.
      Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The values
      are displayed for each field where meaningful.
