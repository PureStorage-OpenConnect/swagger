      type: string
      description: Continuation token that can be provided in the `continuation_token`
        query param to get the next page of data. If you use the continuation token
        to page through data you are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless
        of how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during the pagination
        then it may or may not be returned. The continuation token is generated if
        the limit is less than the remaining number of items, and the default sort
        is used (no sort is specified).
