  continuation_token:
    description: Continuation token that can be provided in the `continuation_token`
      query param to get the next page of data. If you use the `continuation_token`
      to page through data you are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless
      of how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during the pagination
      then it may or may not be returned. The `continuation_token` is generated if
      the `limit` is less than the remaining number of items, and the default sort
      is used (no sort is specified).
    type: string
  total_item_count:
    description: Total number of items after applying `filter` params.
