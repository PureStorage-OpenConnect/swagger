      Continuation token that can be provided in the continuation_token
      query param to get the next page of data.
      If you use the continuation token to page through data you
      are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless of
      how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during
      the pagination then it may or may not be returned.
      The continuation token is generated if the limit is less
      than the remaining number of items, and the default sort is used
      (no sort is specified).
