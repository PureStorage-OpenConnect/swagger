  continuation_token:
    type: string
    description: Continuation token that can be provided in the continuation_token
      query param to get the next page of data. If you use the continuation token
      to page through data you are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless
      of how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during the pagination
      then it may or may not be returned. The continuation token is generated if the
      limit is less than the remaining number of items, and the default sort is used
      (no sort is specified).
