          Continuation token that can be provided in the token query
          param to get the next page of data.
          If you use the continuation token to page through data you
          are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless of
          how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during
          the pagination then it may or may not be returned.
          The continuation token is generated if the limit is less
          than the remaining number of items, and the default sort is used
          (no sort is specified).
