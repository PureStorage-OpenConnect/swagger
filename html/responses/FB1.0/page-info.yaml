        description: Continuation token that can be provided in the `token` query
          param to get the next page of data. If you use the `continuation_token`
          to page through data you are guaranteed to get all items exactly once regardless
          of how items are modified. If an item is added or deleted during the pagination
          then it may or may not be returned. The `continuation_token` is generated
          if the `limit` is less than the remaining number of items, and the default
          sort is used (no sort is specified).
      total_item_count:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: Total number of items after applying `filter` params.
