patch:
  summary: Modify CBS array capacity
  description: Modifies the raw capacity of the CBS array. This should trigger a backend
    process that will update the CBS array capacity. The array capacity can be updated
    only to values defined by the capacity steps endpoint. When an existing capacity
    update request is in progress, any new request to update of the capacity will
    receive an error response. For non-CBS arrays, this feature is not supported and
    requests will receive an error response.
