post:
  summary: Create a host
  description: Creates a host member and adds it to a protection group. Members that
    are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication,
    only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `group_names`
    parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the host. The `group_names` and `member_names`
    parameters are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_ids.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/member_names.query.yaml

delete:
  summary: Delete a host from a protection group
  description: Deletes a host member from a protection group. After the member has
    been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots
    that were taken before the member was removed are not affected. Removing a member
    from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member
    can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `group_names` parameter
    represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names` parameter
    represents the name of the host. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters
    are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
