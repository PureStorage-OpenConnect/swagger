  summary: Create a file copy
  description: Creates a file copy from one path to another path. The `directory_ids`,
    `directory_names` or `paths` value must be specified. If the `directory_ids` or
    `directory_names` value is not specified, the file is copied to the source directory
    specified in the body params. The `paths` value refers to the path of the target
    file relative to the target directory. If `paths` value is not specified, the
    file will be copied to the relative path specified in `source_path` under the
    target directory. The `source_path` value refers to the path of the source file
    relative to the source directory. To overwrite an existing file, set the `overwrite`
    flag to `true`.
