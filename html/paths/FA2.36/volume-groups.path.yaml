  summary: Create a volume group
  description: Creates a volume group. The volume group itself does not contain any
    meaningful content; instead, it acts as a container that is used to organize volumes.
    Once a volume group has been created, volumes can be created inside the volume
    group or moved into and out of the volume group.

  summary: Delete a volume group
  description: Deletes a volume group that has been destroyed and is pending eradication.

    be set together.

  summary: Modify a volume group
  description: Modifies a volume group. You can rename, destroy, recover, or set QoS
    limits for a volume group. To rename a volume group, set `name` to the new name.
    To destroy a volume group, set `destroyed=true`. To recover a volume group that
    has been destroyed and is pending eradication, set `destroyed=false`. Sets the
    bandwidth and IOPs limits of a volume group through the respective `bandwidth_limit`
    and `iops_limit` parameter. The `ids` or `names` parameter is required, but they
    cannot be set together. Sets the priority adjustment for a volume group using
    the `priority_adjustment_operator` and `priority_adjustment_value` fields.
