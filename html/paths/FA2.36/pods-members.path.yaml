  summary: Creatse a member to add to a pod
  description: Creates a stretched pod on an array. When a pod is stretched to an
    array, the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously
    replicated. The `member_names` or `member_ids` parameter represents the array
    over which the pod is to be stretched. Both pod and member must be specified by
    `name` or `ID`.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml

delete:
  summary: Delete a member from a pod
  description: Unstretches a pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a member array.
    Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod no longer
    need to be synchronously replicated between the two members. After a pod has been
    unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version of the pod with
    "restretch" appended to the pod name is created on the member that no longer has
    the pod. The restretch pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod, just
    before it was unstretched. The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period
    starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretch can pod can be
    cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched.
    Both pod and member must be specified by `name` or `ID`.
