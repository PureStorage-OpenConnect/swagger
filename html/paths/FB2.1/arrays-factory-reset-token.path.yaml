post:
  description: Creates a token that can be used to perform a factory reset on the
    array. Factory reset tokens can only be created after the array has been prepared
    for reset (e.g., all file systems, buckets, and snapshots must first be eradicated).
    After a token has been created, operations that would take the array out of the
    prepared state (e.g., creating file systems) are disabled until all tokens have
    been deleted.
