  description: Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency
    data, and average I/O sizes of all host groups, displayed both by host group and
    by total size across all host groups. This data represents volumes that are connected
    to the host groups on the local array and stretched volumes connected to the host
    groups on arrays that are connected by synchronous replication.
