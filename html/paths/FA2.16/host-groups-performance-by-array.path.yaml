  description: Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency
    data, and average I/O size data. The data is displayed by total size across all
    host groups on each array and by individual host group on each array. The displayed
    data represents the volumes that are connected to a host group on the current
    array and the volumes that are connected to a host group on any remote arrays
    that are visible to the current array.
