    pods are stretched. The optional `group_names` parameter represents the name of
    the pod. The optional `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array
    over which the pod is stretched.

  summary: Stretch a pod to an array
  description: Stretches a pod to an array. When a pod is stretched to an array, the
    data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously replicated.
    The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be stretched. The
    `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array over which the pod is
    to be stretched. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required
    and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml

  summary: Unstretch a pod from an array
  description: Unstretches a pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a single array.
    Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod no longer
    need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays. After a pod has been
    unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version of the pod with
    "restretch" appended to the pod name is created on the array that no longer has
    the pod. The restretch pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod, just
    before it was unstretched. The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period
    starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretch can pod can be
    cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `group_names`
    parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched. The `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched.
    The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.
