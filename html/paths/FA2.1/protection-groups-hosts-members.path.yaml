post:
  summary: Add a host to a protection group
  description: Adds a host member to a protection group. Members that are already
    in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members
    of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `group_names` parameter
    represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names` parameter
    represents the name of the host. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters
    are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/member_names.query.yaml

delete:
  summary: Remove a host from a protection group
  description: Removes a host member from a protection group. After the member has
    been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots
    that were taken before the member was removed will not be affected. Removing a
    member from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and
    the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `group_names`
    parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the host. The `group_names` and `member_names`
    parameters are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml
