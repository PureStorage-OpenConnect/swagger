post:
  summary: Add a host group to a protection group
  description: Adds a host group member to a protection group. Members that are already
    in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication, only members
    of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `group_names` parameter
    represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names` parameter
    represents the name of the host group. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters
    are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml

delete:
  summary: Remove a host group from a protection group
  description: Removes a host group member from a protection group. After the member
    has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group
    snapshots that were taken before the member was removed will not be affected.
    Removing a member from a protection group does not delete the member from the
    array, and the member can be added back to the protection group at any time. The
    `group_names` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the host group. The `group_names` and `member_names`
    parameters are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml
