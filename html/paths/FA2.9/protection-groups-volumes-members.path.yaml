delete:
  description: Deletes a volume member from a protection group. After the member has
    been deleted, it is no longer protected by the group. Any protection group snapshots
    that were taken before the member was deleted are not affected. Deleting a member
    from a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member
    can be added back to the protection group at any time. The `group_names` parameter
    represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names` and `member_ids`
    parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume. The `group_names` and only
    one of `member_names` or `member_ids` parameters are required and must be set
    together.

post:
  description: Creates a volume member and adds it to a protection group. Members
    that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous replication,
    only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The `group_names`
    parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names`
    and `member_ids` parameters represent the names or IDs of the volume. The `group_names`
    and only one of `member_names` or `member_ids` parameters are required and must
