  description: Creates a pod on the local array. Each pod must be given a name that
    is unique across the arrays to which they are stretched, so a pod cannot be stretched
    to an array that already contains a pod with the same name. After a pod has been
    created, add volumes and protection groups to the pod, and then stretch the pod
    to another connected array.
