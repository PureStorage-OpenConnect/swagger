delete:
  summary: Delete sessions
  description: Delete sessions. It can be used to either delete an individual session
    by name or multiple sessions filtered by parameters. E.g. to delete SMBv3 sessions
    held by specific client, `protocols` and `client_names` must be specified. To
    prevent accidental deletes, setting flag `disruptive` to `true` is required when
    only a single query parameter is part of the query. E.g. to delete all SMBv3 sessions,
    query parameters `protocols` and `disruptive` must be set. When `names` is specified,
    no other query parameter can be specified.
