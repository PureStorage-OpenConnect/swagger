post:
  summary: Create a factory reset token
  description: Creates a token that can be used to perform a factory reset on the
    array. Factory reset tokens can only be created after the array has been prepared
    for reset (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must first be eradicated). After a
    token has been created, operations that would take the array out of the prepared
    state are disabled (e.g., creating volumes) until all tokens have been deleted.
