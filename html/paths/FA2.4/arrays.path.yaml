delete:
  description: Deletes an array. For physical appliances, deleting an array restores
    the hardware to factory settings. This entails deleting all data, metadata, configuration,
    and logs; the array returns to the state it was in prior to any configuration
    changes being made. If the hardware is reused, it must be as a different array
    with a new ID. For virtual appliances, deleting an array puts it into an unusable
    state. Virtual resources (e.g., virtual machines) can later be freed, which deletes
    any remaining data, metadata, configuration, and logs. Prior to factory reset,
    an array must be manually prepared (e.g., all volumes and snapshots must be eradicated)
    and a factory reset token must be created.
