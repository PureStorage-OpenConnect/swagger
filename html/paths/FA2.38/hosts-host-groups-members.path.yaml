  summary: Create a membership to a host group
  description: Creates a membership to a host group. Creating a membership to a host
    group automatically connects the host to all volumes associated with the group.
    Multiple hosts can be belong to a host group, but a host can only belong to one
    host group. Hosts can be added to host groups at any time. The `group_names` and
    `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together, and only one
    host group can be specified at a time.
  parameters:
