  summary: List pods and their the array members
  description: Displays a list of pods and the local and remote arrays over which
    the pods are stretched. Pods with realm members will not be returned. The optional
    `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod. The optional `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the array over which the pod is stretched. (Deprecated)
    Use pods/members instead.)

  summary: Creates a pod to be stretched to an array
  description: Creates a pod to be stretched to an array. When a pod is stretched
    to an array, the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously
    replicated. The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be stretched.
    The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array over which the pod
    is to be stretched. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required
    and must be set together. (Deprecated) Use pods/members instead.

delete:
  summary: Delete a pod that was stretched to an array
  description: Deletes a pod that was stretchd to an array, collapsing the pod to
    a single array. Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched
    pod no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays. After
    a pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version
    of the pod with 'restretch' appended to the pod name is created on the array that
    no longer has the pod. The restretched pod represents a point-in-time snapshot
    of the pod, just before it was unstretched. The restretch pod enters an eradication
    pending period starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretched
    pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `group_names`
    parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched. The `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched.
    The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.
    (Deprecated) Use pods/members instead.
