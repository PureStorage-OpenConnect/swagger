post:
  summary: Creates a pod to be stretched to a member
  description: Creates a pod to be stretched to a member. When a pod is stretched
    to an array, the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously
    replicated. The `member_names` or `member_ids` parameter represents the array
    over which the pod is to be stretched. Both pod and member must be specified by
    name or ID.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.38/context_names.query.yaml

delete:
  summary: Delete a member from a pod
  description: Deletes a stretched pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a member
    array. Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod
    no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two members. After a
    pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version of
    the pod with 'restretch' appended to the pod name is created on the member that
    no longer has the pod. The restretched pod represents a point-in-time snapshot
    of the pod, just before it was unstretched. The restretched pod enters an eradication
    pending period starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretched
    pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched.
    Both pod and member must be specified by name or ID.
