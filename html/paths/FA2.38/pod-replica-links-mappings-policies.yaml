  summary: Modify policy mappings
  description: Modifies policy mappings of a replica link. Valid `mapping` values
    are `connected` and `disconnected`. `connected` indicates that the source policy
    and its attachments will be mirrored on the target pod. `disconnected` indicates
    that the associated policy and its attachments are independent from any policy
    on the remote. This operation can only be performed on the target side of a pod
    replica link.
