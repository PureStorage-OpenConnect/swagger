post:
  summary: Creates an action to add a host group to a protection group
  description: Creates an action to add a host group member to a protection group.
    Members that are already in the protection group are not affected. For asynchronous
    replication, only members of the same type can belong to a protection group. The
    `group_names` parameter represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names`
    parameter represents the name of the host group. The `group_names` and `member_names`
    parameters are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.38/context_names.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_ids.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/group_names.query.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/member_names.query.yaml

delete:
  summary: Delete a host group from a protection group
  description: Deletes a host group member from a protection group. After the member
    has been removed, it is no longer protected by the group. Protection group snapshots
    taken before the member was removed will not be affected. Removing a member from
    a protection group does not delete the member from the array, and the member can
    be added back to the protection group at any time. The `group_names` parameter
    represents the name of the protection group, and the `member_names` parameter
    represents the name of the host group. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters
    are required and must be set together.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
