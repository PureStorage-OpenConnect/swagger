  summary: List host performance data
  description: Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency
    data, and average I/O sizes across all hosts, displayed by host and by total size
    across all hosts. This data represents volumes that are connected to the hosts
    on the local array and stretched volumes connected to the hosts on any arrays
    that are connected by synchronous replication.
