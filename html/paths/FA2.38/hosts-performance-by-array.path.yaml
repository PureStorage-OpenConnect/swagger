  summary: List host performance data by array
  description: Displays real-time and historical performance data, real-time latency
    data, and average I/O size data. The data is displayed by total size across all
    hosts on each array and by individual host on each array. The displayed data represents
    the volumes that are connected to a host on the current array and the volumes
    that are connected to a host on any remote arrays that are visible to the current
    array.
