post:
  summary: Create pod replica links
  description: Creates pod replica links between two arrays. The `local_pod_names`
    and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`,
    `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating`
    indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of
    `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent.
    During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the
    link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused
    ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy`
    indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some
    health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the
    source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to
    the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that
    the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target
    pod.
