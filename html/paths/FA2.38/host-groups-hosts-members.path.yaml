post:
  summary: Create a membership to a host group
  description: Create a membership between a host and a host group. Adding a membership
    to a host group automatically connects the host to all volumes associated with
    the group. Multiple hosts can be belong to a host group, but a host can only belong
    to one host group. Hosts can be added to host groups at any time. The `group_names`
    and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together, and only
    one host group can be specified at a time.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/authorization.header.yaml
  - $ref: ../../queries/FA2.0/x-request-id.header.yaml

  summary: Delete a membership from a host group
  description: Deletes a membership from a host group. Removing a membership from
    a host group automatically disconnects the host from all volumes associated with
    the group. Hosts can be removed from host groups at any time. The `group_names`
    and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together, and only
    one host group can be specified at a time.
