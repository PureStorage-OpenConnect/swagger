post:
  summary: Create a vchost-connection between protocol endpoint and vchost.
  description: Creates a vchost-connection between protocol endpoint and vchost. Each
    vchost is associated with a vCenter. Each protocol endpoint is associated with
    a storage container. A vchost-connection makes the storage container accessible
    to the vCenter when the vCenter attempts to mount the container. One of `protocol_endpoint_names`
    or `protocol_endpoint_ids` query parameters and one of `vchost_names` or `vchost_ids`
    query parameters are required. But if `all_vchosts` is set to `true`, `vchost_names`
    and `vchost_ids` should not be specified.

  description: Deletes the vchost-connection between a protocol endpoint and its vchost.
    The storage container represented by the protocol endpoint will no longer be visible
    to the vCenter represented by the vchost. One of the `protocol_endpoint_names`
    or `protocol_endpoint_ids` query parameters, and one of the `vchost_names` or
    `vchost_ids` query parameters are required. But if `all_vchosts` is set to `true`,
    `vchost_names` and `vchost_ids` should not be specified.
