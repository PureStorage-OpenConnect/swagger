  summary: Initiate NLM reclamation.
  description: NLM reclamation is a system-wide operation, affecting all clients,
    and so only one may be in progress at a time. Attempting to initiate reclamation
    while one is in progress will result in an error. When NLM reclamation is initiated,
    all NLM locks are deleted and client applications are notified that they can reacquire
    their locks within a grace period.
