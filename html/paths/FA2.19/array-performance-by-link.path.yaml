  summary: List array front-end IO performance data by link
  description: Displays real-time and historical front-end performance data at the
    array level including latency, bandwidth, IOPS, average I/O size, and queue depth.
    Group output is shown by link. A link represents a set of arrays that an I/O operation
    depends on. For local-only I/Os, this is a local array. For mirrored I/Os, this
    is a set of synchronous replication peer arrays.
