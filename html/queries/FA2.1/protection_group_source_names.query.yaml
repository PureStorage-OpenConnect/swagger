  into a new or existing protection group. If the destination protection group and
  all of its volumes already exist, include the `overwrite` parameter to overwrite
  all of the existing volumes with the snapshot contents. If including the `overwrite`
  parameter, the names of the volumes that are being overwritten must match the names
  of the volumes that are being restored. If the source is a protection group, the
