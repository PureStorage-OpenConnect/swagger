description: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where
  `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end of the
  time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified in milliseconds
  since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default
  to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance
  data will be displayed. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default
  to the current time. Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance
  data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the
  lowest valid resolution.
