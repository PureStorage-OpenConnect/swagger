description: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide
  performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1
  second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000`
  (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics
  on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid
  values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000`
  (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object
  name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes),
  `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the
  `start_time` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified
  start time. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one
  resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance
  data will be displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance
  data until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will
  default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not specified but
  either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then `resolution` will default
  to the lowest valid resolution.
