description: >-
  If set to `true`, reduces the size of a volume
  during a volume resize operation.
  When a volume is truncated, Purity automatically takes an undo snapshot,
  providing a 24-hour window during which the previous contents
  can be retrieved. After truncating a volume,
  its provisioned size can be subsequently increased,
  but the data in truncated sectors cannot be retrieved.
  If set to `false` or not set at all and the volume is being reduced in size,
  the volume copy operation fails.
  Required if the `provisioned` parameter is set to a volume size
  that is smaller than the original size.
type: boolean
