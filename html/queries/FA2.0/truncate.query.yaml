name: truncate
in: query
description: If set to `true`, reduces the size of a volume during a volume resize
  operation. When a volume is truncated, Purity automatically takes an undo snapshot,
  providing a 24-hour window during which the previous contents can be retrieved.
  After truncating a volume, its provisioned size can be subsequently increased, but
  the data in truncated sectors cannot be retrieved. If set to `false` or not set
  at all and the volume is being reduced in size, the volume copy operation fails.
  Required if the `provisioned` parameter is set to a volume size that is smaller
  than the original size.
