name: volume_ids
in: query
description: Performs the operation on the specified volume. Enter multiple ids in
  comma-separated format. For example, `vol01id,vol02id`. A request cannot include
  a mix of multiple objects with multiple IDs. For example, a request cannot include
  a mix of multiple volume IDs and host names; instead, at least one of the objects
  (e.g., `volume_ids`) must be set to only one name (e.g., `vol01id`). Only one of
  the two between `volume_names` and `volume_ids` may be used at a time.
