description: Allow update operations that lead to a `hard_limit_enabled` object store
  account, bucket, or file system with usage over its limiting value. For object store
  accounts and buckets, the limiting value is that of `quota_limit`, and for file
  systems it is that of `provisioned`. The operation can be either setting `hard_limit_enabled`
  when usage is higher than the limiting value, or modifying the limiting value to
  a value under usage when `hard_limit_enabled` is `true`.
