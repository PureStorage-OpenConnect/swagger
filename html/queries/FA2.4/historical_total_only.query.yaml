name: total_only
in: query
description: If set to `true`, only return the aggregate value of all items after
  filtering. For real-time performance, the values are aggregated for the latest timestamp.
  For historical performance, the values are aggregated for each timestamp from `start_time`
  to `end_time`. Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead.
  The values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`, the
  `items` list will be empty.
