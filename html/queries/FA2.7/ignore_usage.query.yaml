description: Flag used to override checks for quota management operations. If set
  to `true`, directory usage is not checked against the `quota_limits` that are set.
  If set to `false`, the actual logical bytes in use are prevented from exceeding
  the limits set on the directory. Client operations might be impacted. If the limit
  exceeds the quota, the client operation is not allowed. If not specified, defaults
  to `false`.
