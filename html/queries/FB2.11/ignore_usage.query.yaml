description: Allow update operations that lead to a `hard_limit_enabled` object store
  account, bucket, or file system with usage over its limiting value. For object store
  accounts and buckets, the limiting value is that of `quota_limit`, and for file
  systems it is that of `provisioned`. The operation can be either setting `hard_limit_enabled`
  when usage is higher than the limiting value, modifying the limiting value to a
  value under usage when `hard_limit_enabled` or recovering a destroyed bucket of
  an object store account that cause account's space usage to go over its hard `quota_limit`.
