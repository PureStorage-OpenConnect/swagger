description: The resource types to list the available metrics. Valid values are `arrays`,
  `buckets`, `directories`, `file-systems`, `pods`, `subscription-licenses` and `volumes`.
  A metric can belong to a combination of resources, e.g., write-iops from array to
  pod. In that case, query by ['arrays', 'pods']. Single quotes are required around
