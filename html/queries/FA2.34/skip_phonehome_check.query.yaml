description: A flag to skip phonehome connectivity check. If `skip_phonehome_check`
  is not set, the factory reset will fail if phonehome connectivity check fails. Arrays
  that intentionally disable phonehome or do not permit connectivity to Pure Storage's
  cloud servers must set this flag to `true` in order to start factory reset.
