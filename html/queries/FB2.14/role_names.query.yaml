name: role_names
description: A comma-separated list of role_names. If there is not at least one resource
  that matches each of the elements of `role_names`, then an error is returned. This
  cannot be provided together with the `ids`, `names`, or `role_ids` query parameters.
  This query parameter is deprecated for use with directory service roles. If this
  parameter is used to query or modify directory service roles, but more than 1 configuration
  exists with a given role name, an error will be returned in order to avoid ambiguous
  operation.
