name: role_ids
description: A comma-separated list of role_ids. If after filtering, there is not
  at least one resource that matches each of the elements of `role_ids`, then an error
  is returned. This cannot be provided together with the `ids`, `names` or `role_names`
  query parameters. This query parameter is deprecated for use with directory service
  roles. If this parameter is used to query or modify directory service roles, but
  more than 1 configuration exists with a given role id, an error will be returned
  in order to avoid ambiguous operation.
