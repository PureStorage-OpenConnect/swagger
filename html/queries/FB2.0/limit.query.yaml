description: Limit the size of the response to the specified number of resources.
  A `limit` of `0` can be used to get the number of resources without getting all
  of the resources. It will be returned in the `total_item_count` field. If a client
  asks for a page size larger than the maximum number, the request is still valid.
  In that case the server just returns the maximum number of items, disregarding the
  client's page size request.
