description: This parameter must be set to `true` in order to change a file system's
  `access_control_style` from a style that supports more detailed access control lists
  to a style that only supports less detailed mode bits as a form of permission control.
  This parameter may not be set to `true` any other time. Setting this parameter to
  `true` is acknowledgement that any more detailed access control lists currently
  set within the file system will be lost, and NFS permission controls will only be
  enforced at the granularity level of NFS mode bits.
