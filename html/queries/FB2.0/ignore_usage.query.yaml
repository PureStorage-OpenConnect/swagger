description: Allow update operations that lead to a `hard_limit_enabled` file system
  with usage over its provisioned size. The update can be either setting `hard_limit_enabled`
  when usage is higher than provisioned size, or resize provisioned size to a value
  under usage when `hard_limit_enabled` is `true`.
