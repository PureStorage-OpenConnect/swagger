          This provides strong verification of the identity of users accessing data

            Valid values are `offline`, `online`, `resyncing`, `suspended`, and `unknown`.

            If set to `offline`, the array is experiencing problems

            and may not have the latest pod data.

            The array cannot handle I/O to the pod and cannot take over

            during a high availability event.

            If set to `online`, the array is online and has the latest pod data.

            The array can handle I/O to the pod and take over during a high availability
            event.

            If set to `suspended`, the array is experiencing a short connection glitch
            of the pod.

            This is a temporary status and would transition to either `online` or
            `offline` soon.

            `suspended` is a new status that is exposed, starting from version 6.6.0.

            If set to `resyncing`, the array is actively getting the latest pod data

            so that it becomes fully synchronized with its peer array.

            During the resyncing process, the array cannot handle I/O to the pod.

            Once the arrays are fully synchronized, the array changes to `online`
            status.

            If set to `unknown`, the status of the peer array is unknown

            because this array is offline and cannot determine the state of the pod
            on the peer array.

            Only the peer array can ever be in unknown status; this unknown status

            is unique to the local array and will differ when viewed from its peer
            array.

          Infinite is represented by `null`.

          The provisioned size for a host or host group, includes all volumes

        When a pod is stretched to an array,

        the data in the arrays over which the pod is stretched is synchronously replicated.

        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be stretched.

        The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array over which the
        pod is

        to be stretched.

        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set
        together.

    snapshots. A volume snapshot is a snapshot that captures the contents of a single
    volume.

    A protection group volume snapshot is a volume snapshot that is created from a
