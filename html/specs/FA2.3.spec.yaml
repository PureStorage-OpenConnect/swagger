  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashArray\nA light weight tool to explore
    the API for FlashArray, community supported. \nFor  help with this tool, use [Pure1
    Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\n##
    Authenticate using API Token\nTo get an API Key, you can do POST /auth/apitoken
    with your user/pass using the 1.x API, then use your API key with POST /login.
    \ The array returns \na header  with the name \"x-auth-token\".  This swagger
    UI tool, translates that into a cookie so the webbrowser will send on subsequent
    calls.  This Swagger UI tool then\ntranslates that cookie back into a header when
    making the API request to the array.\n\n## Authenticate using OAuth\n### Manually
    generate an id_token \n\n### \n\nIntro to how OAuth2 works with the 2.0 version:

      summary: Unstretch a pod from an array
      description: 'Unstretches a pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a single
        array.

        Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod

        no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays.

        After a pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops.

        A destroyed version of the pod with "restretch" appended to the pod name

        is created on the array that no longer has the pod.

        The restretch pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod,

        just before it was unstretched.

        The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period

        starting from the time that the pod was unstretched.

        A restretch can pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly
        recovered.

        The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched.

        The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array from which the
        pod is

        to be unstretched.

        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set
        together.

          integers in the range of 1 to 4095.


          The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single

          int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).


          In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun".

          Example: LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2

          Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.

          In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.


          To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts

          at LUN ''1'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts

          at LUN ''254'' and counts down to the minimum LUN ''1'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the ''[1...254]'' range
          are

          taken, the system starts at LUN ''255'' and counts up to the maximum LUN

          ''4095'', assigning the first available LUN to the connection. The maximum
