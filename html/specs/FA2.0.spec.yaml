  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashArray\nA light weight tool to explore
    the API for FlashArray, community supported. \nFor  help with this tool, use [Pure1
    Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\n##
    Authenticate using API Token\nTo get an API Key, you can do POST /auth/apitoken
    with your user/pass using the 1.x API, then use your API key with POST /login.
    \ The array returns \na header  with the name \"x-auth-token\".  This swagger
    UI tool, translates that into a cookie so the webbrowser will send on subsequent
    calls.  This Swagger UI tool then\ntranslates that cookie back into a header when
    making the API request to the array.\n\n## Authenticate using OAuth\n### Manually
    generate an id_token \n\n### \n\nIntro to how OAuth2 works with the 2.0 version:

          LUN, or a LUN and Sublun with virtual volumes. A LUN and Sublun are

          integers in the range of 1 to 4095.


          The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single

          int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).


          In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun".

          Example: LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2

          Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.

          In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.


          To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts

          at LUN ''1'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts

          at LUN ''254'' and counts down to the minimum LUN ''1'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the ''[1...254]'' range
          are

          taken, the system starts at LUN ''255'' and counts up to the maximum LUN

          ''4095'', assigning the first available LUN to the connection. The maximum

    and public (host group-volume) connections.

    A private connection connects one volume to one host.

    Private connections are typically used for boot volumes

    and for stand-alone (non-clustered) host applications.

    A shared connection connects a designated set of hosts (via a host group)

    to a designated set of volumes, providing the hosts with a consistent "view" of
    the volumes.

    All associated hosts use the same LUN to address a given associated volume.

    All hosts and volumes associated with a host group are

    automatically connected to each other by virtue of their associations with the
    group.

    Shared connections are useful for cluster applications in which several related
    hosts require

    consistent (same LUN) connectivity to a set of storage volumes.

- name: Host Groups
  description: 'Host groups implement consistent connections between a set of hosts
    and one or more volumes.

    Connections are consistent in the sense that all hosts associated with a host
    group

    address a volume connected to the group by the same LUN. Host groups are typically

    used to provide a common view of storage volumes to the hosts in a clustered application.

  description: 'Hosts organize the storage network addresses

    (iSCSI Qualified Names, NVMe qualified names, or Fibre Channel world wide names)

    of client computers to identify the host''s intiators.

    Hosts also control communications between clients and volumes.

    After a volume has been created,

    establish a host-volume connection so that the host

    can read data from and write data to the volume.

- name: Volumes
  description: 'A volume represents a container that manages the storage space on
    the array.

    After a volume has been created, establish a host-volume connection so that the
    host

    can read data from and write data to the volume.

    Furthermore, protect the volume data through asynchronous replication to a remote
    array,

    synchronous replication between remote arrays, and replication to external storage
    systems.

    '
- name: Volume Snapshots
  description: 'Volume snapshots are immutable, point-in-time images of the contents
    of one or more volumes.

    There are two types of volume snapshots&#58;

    volume snapshots and protection group volume snapshots.

    A volume snapshot is a snapshot that captures the contents of a single volume.

    A protection group volume snapshot is a volume snapshot that is created from a
    group of

    volumes that are part of the same protection group. All of the volume snapshots
    created from a

    protection group snapshot are point-in-time consistent with each other.
