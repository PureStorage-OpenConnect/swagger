    and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate to the Pure Storage REST API. Before

- description: An API client represents an identity type. API clients are created
    on the array. To create an API client, register and then enable it on the array.
    After the API client has been created, the user name (`sub`) and identity tokens
    (`kid` and `aud` tokens) that are issued by the API client are used as claims
    for the JSON Web Token that you create to authenticate into the REST API.
  name: API Clients
- description: A connection gives hosts access to volumes on the array. The system
    supports private (host-volume) connections and public (host group-volume) connections.
    A private connection connects one volume to one host. Private connections are
    typically used for boot volumes and for stand-alone (non-clustered) host applications.
    A shared connection connects a designated set of hosts (via a host group) to a
    designated set of volumes, providing the hosts with a consistent "view" of the
    volumes. All associated hosts use the same LUN to address a given associated volume.
    All hosts and volumes associated with a host group are automatically connected
    to each other by virtue of their associations with the group. Shared connections
    are useful for cluster applications in which several related hosts require consistent
    (same LUN) connectivity to a set of storage volumes.
  name: Connections
- description: Host groups implement consistent connections between a set of hosts
    and one or more volumes. Connections are consistent in the sense that all hosts
    associated with a host group address a volume connected to the group by the same
    LUN. Host groups are typically used to provide a common view of storage volumes
    to the hosts in a clustered application.
  name: Host Groups
- description: Hosts organize the storage network addresses (iSCSI Qualified Names,
    NVMe qualified names, or Fibre Channel world wide names) of client computers to
    identify the host's intiators. Hosts also control communications between clients
    and volumes. After a volume has been created, establish a host-volume connection
    so that the host can read data from and write data to the volume.
  name: Hosts
- description: The offload feature enables system administrators to replicate point-in-time
    volume snapshots from the array to an external storage system for long-term retention.
    Each offload target represents an external storage system, such as an Azure Blob
    container, NFS device, or S3 bucket, to where Purity//FA volume snapshots can
    be replicated.
  name: Offloads
- description: Synchronous replication is managed through pods. A pod representing
    a collection of protection groups and volumes is created on one array and stretched
    to another array, resulting in fully synchronized writes between the two arrays.
    A pod can contain a mix of volumes, and protection groups with member volumes.
    Writes to the pod coming into either array are immediately synchronized and seen
    on both arrays.
  name: Pods
- description: A protection group defines a set of volumes, hosts, or host groups
    (called members) that are protected together through snapshots with point-in-time
    consistency across the member volumes. The members within the protection group
    have common data protection requirements and the same snapshot, replication, and
    retention schedules. Protection group members include volumes, hosts, and host
    groups. After a protection group has been created, configure the protection group
    schedule to generate and replicate snapshots to another array or to an external
    storage system.
  name: Protection Groups
- description: Protection group snapshots capture the content of all volumes on the
    source array for the specified protection group at a single point in time. The
    snapshot is an immutable image of the volume data at that instance in time. The
    volumes are either direct members of the protection group or connected to any
    of its hosts or host groups within a protection group. Volumes are protected through
    protection group snapshots that are retained locally, replicated to other arrays
    or storage systems, or both. Protection group snapshots can be manually generated
    on demand or enabled to automatically generate at scheduled intervals. After a
    protection group snapshot has been taken, it is either stored on the local array
    or replicated over to a remote (target) array.
  name: Protection Group Snapshots
- description: A remote pod represents a pod that is on a connected array but not
    stretched to this array.
  name: Remote Pods
- description: A remote protection group represents a protection group that resides
    on an offload target with the source side of the remote protection group being
    another array that is connected to the local array. The local array can only see
    the remote protection groups of other arrays if the two arrays are connected.
  name: Remote Protection Groups
- description: A remote protection group snapshot represents a protection group snapshot
    that resides on an offload target with the source side of the remote protection
    group snapshot being another array that is connected to the local array. The local
    array can only see the remote protection group snapshots of other arrays if the
    two arrays are connected.
  name: Remote Protection Group Snapshots
- description: A remote volume snapshot represents a volume snapshot that resides
    on an offload target with the source side of the remote volume snapshot being
    another array that is connected to the local array. The local array can only see
    the remote volume snapshots of other arrays if the two arrays are connected.
  name: Remote Volume Snapshots
- description: A volume represents a container that manages the storage space on the
    array. After a volume has been created, establish a host-volume connection so
    that the host can read data from and write data to the volume. Furthermore, protect
    the volume data through asynchronous replication to a remote array, synchronous
    replication between remote arrays, and replication to external storage systems.
  name: Volumes
- description: Volume groups organize volumes into logical groupings. If virtual volumes
    are configured, each volume group on the FlashArray array represents its associated
    virtual machine, and inside each of those volumes groups are the FlashArray volumes
    that are assigned to the virtual machine. Volume groups that are associated with
    virtual machines have names that begin with `vvol-` and end with the virtual machine
    name.
  name: Volume Groups
- description: Volume snapshots are immutable, point-in-time images of the contents
    of one or more volumes. There are two types of volume snapshots&#58; volume snapshots
    and protection group volume snapshots. A volume snapshot is a snapshot that captures
    the contents of a single volume. A protection group volume snapshot is a volume
    snapshot that is created from a group of volumes that are part of the same protection
    group. All of the volume snapshots created from a protection group snapshot are
    point-in-time consistent with each other.
