  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashBlade\nA light weight tool to explore\
    \ the API for FlashBlade, community supported.  \nFor help with this tool, use\
    \ [Pure1 Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage\
    \ Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\
    \n## Authentication\nUse an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login,\
    \ that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default.\
    \ This is\ndifferent than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token\
    \ is saved and added by the built in proxy server.\n\nUse \"pureadmin create --api-token\"\
    \ on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use \"pureadmin list --api-token --expose\"\
    \ to show a token already created.  Note, it only shows tokens for user that is\
    \ logged in.\n\n## Proxy\nThis Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards\
    \ API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \\\nsee curl API calls\
    \ to IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view\
    \ the console output.\n\n## Error Codes\nUse HTTP Response codes to determine\
    \ command results.  Error message json formats are different depending on the\
    \ endpoint.\n\n## Official Documention\nGo to the Pure support portal for the\
    \ [full documentation](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashBlade/Purity_FB/Purity%2F%2F%2F%2FFB_REST_API/Management_REST_API/Management_REST_API_Reference_Guides)."
