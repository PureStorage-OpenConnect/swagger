    \n## Authentication\nUse an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login,\
    \ that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default.\
    \ This is\ndifferent than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token\
    \ is saved and added by the built in proxy server.\n\nUse \"pureadmin create --api-token\"\
    \ on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use \"pureadmin list --api-token --expose\"\
    \ to show a token already created.  Note, it only shows tokens for user that is\
    \ logged in.\n\n## Proxy\nThis Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards\
    \ API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \\\nsee curl API calls\
    \ to IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view\
    \ the console output.\n\n## Error Codes\nUse HTTP Response codes to determine\
