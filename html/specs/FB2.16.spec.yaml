  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashBlade\nA light weight tool to explore
    the API for FlashBlade, community supported.  \nFor help with this tool, use [Pure1
    Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\n##
    Authentication\nUse an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login,
    that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default. This
    is\ndifferent than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token
    is saved and added by the built in proxy server.\n\nUse \"pureadmin create --api-token\"
    on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use \"pureadmin list --api-token --expose\"
    to show a token already created.  Note, it only shows tokens for user that is
    logged in.\n\n## Proxy\nThis Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards
    API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \\\nsee curl API calls to
    IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view the console
    output.\n\n## Error Codes\nUse HTTP Response codes to determine command results.
    \ Error message json formats are different depending on the endpoint.\n\n## Official
    Documention\nGo to the Pure support portal for the [full documentation](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashBlade/Purity_FB/Purity%2F%2F%2F%2FFB_REST_API/Management_REST_API/Management_REST_API_Reference_Guides)."
