  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashArray\nA light weight tool to explore
    the API for FlashArray, community supported. \nFor  help with this tool, use [Pure1
    Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\n##
    Authenticate using API Token\nTo get an API Key, you can do POST /auth/apitoken
    with your user/pass using the 1.x API, then use your API key with POST /login.
    \ The array returns \na header  with the name \"x-auth-token\".  This swagger
    UI tool, translates that into a cookie so the webbrowser will send on subsequent
    calls.  This Swagger UI tool then\ntranslates that cookie back into a header when
    making the API request to the array.\n\n## Authenticate using OAuth\n### Manually
    generate an id_token \n\n### \n\nIntro to how OAuth2 works with the 2.0 version:

          LUN, or a LUN and Sublun with virtual volumes. A LUN and Sublun are

          integers in the range of 1 to 4095.


          The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single

          int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).


          In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun".

          Example: LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2

          Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.

          In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.


          To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts

          at LUN ''1'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts

          at LUN ''254'' and counts down to the minimum LUN ''1'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the ''[1...254]'' range
          are

          taken, the system starts at LUN ''255'' and counts up to the maximum LUN

          ''4095'', assigning the first available LUN to the connection. The maximum

          int64 LUN:Sublun value is 17587891081215.
