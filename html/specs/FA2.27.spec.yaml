  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashArray\nA light weight tool to explore\
    \ the API for FlashArray, community supported. \nFor  help with this tool, use\
    \ [Pure1 Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage\
    \ Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\
    \n## Authenticate using API Token\nTo get an API Key, you can do POST /auth/apitoken\
    \ with your user/pass using the 1.x API, then use your API key with POST /login.\
    \  The array returns \na header  with the name \"x-auth-token\".  This swagger\
    \ UI tool, translates that into a cookie so the webbrowser will send on subsequent\
    \ calls.  This Swagger UI tool then\ntranslates that cookie back into a header\
    \ when making the API request to the array.\n\n## Authenticate using OAuth\n###\
    \ Manually generate an id_token \n\n### \n\nIntro to how OAuth2 works with the\
    \ 2.0 version: [Intro](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Purity_FA_REST_API/Reference/REST_API_2.0_Authentication_Guide)"

- description: Volume snapshots are immutable, point-in-time images of the contents
    of one or more volumes. There are two types of volume snapshots&#58; volume snapshots
