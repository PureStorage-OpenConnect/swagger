          LUN, or a LUN and Sublun with virtual volumes. A LUN and Sublun are

          integers in the range of 1 to 4095.


          The first format is simply the LUN number. The second format is a single

          int64 combining both ((LUN << 32) + Sublun) or (LUN * 4294967296 + Sublun).


          In the FA UI, a combined LUN and Sublun is represented as "LUN:Sublun".

          Example: LUN = 30, Sublun = 2, LUN:Sublun = 30:2

          Combined: (30 * 4294967296 + 2) == 128849018882.

          In REST it will be returned as 128849018882.


          To automatically assign a LUN to a private connection, the system starts

          at LUN ''1'' and counts up to the maximum LUN ''4095'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. For shared connections, the system starts

          at LUN ''254'' and counts down to the minimum LUN ''1'', assigning the first

          available LUN to the connection. If all LUNs in the ''[1...254]'' range
          are

          taken, the system starts at LUN ''255'' and counts up to the maximum LUN

          ''4095'', assigning the first available LUN to the connection. The maximum

          int64 LUN:Sublun value is 17587891081215.

    \n## Authenticate using API Token\nTo get an API Key, you can do POST /auth/apitoken\
    \ with your user/pass using the 1.x API, then use your API key with POST /login.\
    \  The array returns \na header  with the name \"x-auth-token\".  This swagger\
    \ UI tool, translates that into a cookie so the webbrowser will send on subsequent\
    \ calls.  This Swagger UI tool then\ntranslates that cookie back into a header\
    \ when making the API request to the array.\n\n## Authenticate using OAuth\n###\

        Adding a host to a host group automatically

        connects the host to all volumes associated with the group.

        Multiple hosts can be belong to a host group,

        but a host can only belong to one host group.

        Hosts can be added to host groups at any time.

        The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required

        and must be set together, and only one host group can be specified at a time.

      description: Creates pod replica links between two arrays. The `local_pod_names`
        and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`,
        `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating`
        indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status
        of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being
        sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing
        the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status
        of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status
        of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers
        must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing`
        indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the
        most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status
        of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes
        have been replicated to the target pod.
