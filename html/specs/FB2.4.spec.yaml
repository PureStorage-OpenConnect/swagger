  description: "## Pure Swagger UI for FlashBlade\nA light weight tool to explore
    the API for FlashBlade, community supported.  \nFor help with this tool, use [Pure1
    Community](https://community.purestorage.com/) or the [code-purestorage Slack](https://community.purestorage.com/discussion/9561/join-the-new-pure-code-slack-team-for-api-and-extensibility-discussions)\n\n##
    Authentication\nUse an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login,
    that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default. This
    is\ndifferent than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token
    is saved and added by the built in proxy server.\n\nUse \"pureadmin create --api-token\"
    on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use \"pureadmin list --api-token --expose\"
    to show a token already created.  Note, it only shows tokens for user that is
    logged in.\n\n## Proxy\nThis Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards
    API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \\\nsee curl API calls to
    IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view the console
    output.\n\n## Error Codes\nUse HTTP Response codes to determine command results.
    \ Error message json formats are different depending on the endpoint.\n\n## Official
    Documention\nGo to the Pure support portal for the [full documentation](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashBlade/Purity_FB/Purity%2F%2F%2F%2FFB_REST_API/Management_REST_API/Management_REST_API_Reference_Guides)."

        tokens have been deleted.

          The `max_role` field is a reference to a `role`.

          Valid `role`s are `readonly`, `ops_admin`, `array_admin`, and `storage_admin`.

          Users with the `readonly` (Read Only) role can perform operations that convey
          the

          state of the array. Read Only users cannot alter the state of the array.

          Users with the `ops_admin` (Ops Admin) role can perform the same operations

          Read Only users plus enable and disable remote assistance sessions. Ops
          Admin users cannot

          alter the state of the array.

          Users with the `storage_admin` (Storage Admin) role can perform the same

          operations as Read Only users plus storage related operations, such as administering
          volumes,

          hosts, and host groups.

          Storage Admin users cannot perform operations that deal with global and
          system configurations.

          Users with the `array_admin` (Array Admin) role can perform the same

          operations as Storage Admin users plus array-wide changes dealing with global
          and system
